1,2:01,are you ready to rumble,
2,2:08,today we are facing off saddling versus fauna who will have the superior food,
3,2:15,opinion it is the most important question in the world people debate all kinds of things but i,
4,2:22,know you all want to know which dessert belongs in the s tier the,
5,2:29,eight here the b tier the c's here the d tier and the forbidden,
6,2:35,[Applause],
7,2:46,wow suddenly the microphone sounds so clear wow,
8,2:51,hello everyone welcome welcome \ntoday yes\ndid i make my mind too loud ,
9,2:58,i don't know okay \nhello today we are ranking more foods ,
10,3:06,this time we are ranking desserts\nwill this be more or less contentious than the fruit and vegetable tierlist,contentious - 논쟁의
11,3:13,i don't know\ni mean people like desserts\ni like desserts desserts are pretty yummy ,
12,3:20,all across the board\num a few caveats\nfirst of all,caveats - 주의사항
13,3:27,the grades have been normalized\nwe are grading on a curve,
14,3:32,because in truth there is no bad dessert well,
15,3:38,there are few bad desserts\nyou know it's all\nit's all fatty sugar,
16,3:45,delicious horrible for you\neverybody loves it,
17,3:51,so consider it this way\nyou know it's an f tier but that might not mean it's bad,
18,3:57,it just means it's f relative to all the other desserts out there,
19,4:02,second caveat\nyou know i don't know,
20,4:03,if i want to do coffees because i feel like it makes less fun right\nwe're all here to scream at each other anyway,
21,4:10,um this is just my opinion it's not based on any science it is,
22,4:17,purely based on how i feel in the moment but you know what who cares about that,
23,4:23,right who cares who cares if it's my opinion you can have a wrong opinion about,cares -  신경쓰다\n긍정적인 의미 말고도 쓰임
24,4:30,desserts and i'm sure we're going to figure that out today,
25,4:35,you don't like carrot cake i'm sorry i cannot agree with that as a person that,
26,4:40,must be you are incorrect your opinion is wrong your subjective,
27,4:46,experience of enjoying foods is wrong,
28,4:51,um anyway third caveat\nuh do not judge based on the photos here,
29,4:57,because i have once again \ncurated a copyright free cheerleader made by yours ,
30,5:03,truly except this time check it out we have a bonus i've written the names,
31,5:11,of the desserts because it gets confusing so the names are all there,
32,5:17,um not every dessert is on this list because well,
33,5:23,it's it's just not i don't feel qualified to rank every dessert so i just picked some that i'm,
34,5:30,familiar with we've got a quite a big variety here though we'll cover cover some bases i'm sorry if i'm not,
35,5:37,ranking your favorite dessert um it's probably for the better so that i don't accidentally put it in the f tier and,
36,5:42,then you have to cancel your membership um because the pictures might be wacky,
37,5:49,because they're all from royalty free websites which i want to tell you something really funny about these,
38,5:54,websites so there are a lot of stock image websites i'm sure you're all familiar,
39,6:00,with them like perhaps you know i stock yes but that costs money,
40,6:06,and i mean i could sometimes it's like 30 dollars an image and i have over 40,
41,6:12,images here that's a lot of money for making a silly tear list so you know,
42,6:18,i go on the free ones the free ones they cost no money but i,
43,6:24,realized something crazy about the free websites so when you're searching for,
44,6:29,your stock image like for example i was searching for a black and white cookie because i needed to include it for,
45,6:35,reasons um i could not find any free stock images,
46,6:41,of black and wine cookies there were none but these websites are so tricky because,
47,6:48,they will display within the search the search results suddenly you'll see a,
48,6:55,bunch of amazing stock images like way better high quality they're not weirdly,
49,7:00,artsy like a lot of these talk images are it's just the food on a white,
50,7:06,background and you think oh my god that's the perfect photo i've been looking for that stock photo and then,
51,7:12,you realize it's an advertisement for i stock they place advertisements for,
52,7:18,better stock photos within the search results of the the free stock photos,
53,7:24,that's how they get you so you see all these random artsy photos,
54,7:30,and then amongst the rabble is the glorious premium stock photos and you,
55,7:36,just see what you're missing out on i thought that was pretty funny [Music],
56,7:42,it is pretty genius you would think there would be competitors with eyestock or something but,
57,7:48,i don't know i guess they worked out a deal,
58,7:53,anyway those are my caveats now we can proceed to yell at each other,
59,7:59,for the next however long it takes to go through these i have like 43 i think,
60,8:07,oh we have another caveat actually um down here at the bottom,
61,8:13,there is some breakfast items well quote unquote breakfast items,
62,8:20,i debated on whether or not i should include them because then i was like well maybe i'll do a breakfast,
63,8:25,list at some point but i don't know i feel like these are sweet enough i mean truly they are desserts,
64,8:32,they are desserts you can call them breakfast but that doesn't make it any healthier it is dessert,
65,8:39,now i'm not going to judge you if you eat it for breakfast i've eaten many things on this list for breakfast,
66,8:45,including cake you know it happens i'm not going to judge you but,
67,8:50,i think you know we have to be honest with ourselves,
68,8:55,french toast it's dessert it can also be breakfast but it's,
69,9:02,dessert um anyway anyway,
70,9:08,let's get started i suppose,
71,9:15,now we're starting off pretty strong with number one perhaps the most iconic,
72,9:21,desserts one of them the most iconic cookie probably,
73,9:26,chocolate chip cookies um i don't want to put them in the s here,
74,9:33,because they're kind of basic but i love chocolate chip cookies they're not my favorite cookie but,
75,9:40,they're probably my second favorite cookie and they're delicious especially when done well i love the chewy ones,
76,9:47,the most ah i don't know i do feel like maybe,
77,9:53,it's i don't know we might have too many in the s here because it's dessert and it's delicious but,
78,9:59,i'm gonna put them in s because they're they're iconic you know i feel like they have paved the way for other cookies to,
79,10:06,exist we have to give the chocolate chip cookies the respect that they deserve,
80,10:14,and you know you could probably say the same about our next contender cheesecake,
81,10:19,also way another thing it took me so long to put the words on here,
82,10:24,i don't know how it took so long to create my copyright free tier list i,
83,10:31,just wanted to tell you that that i worked really hard before you type your angry comment just remember,
84,10:38,that i spent so many hours painstakingly putting subtitles on all,
85,10:43,of these anyway okay um cheesecake i used to like cheesecake a lot more,
86,10:50,than i like it now wait there's another caveat actually um,
87,10:55,i am a vegan i know i know i know i know,
88,11:02,but there are vegan versions of most of these desserts i like to bake myself too anyway um but i think i like cheesecake,
89,11:11,more when you know i wasn't vegan well you know i guess since i'm a kieran,
90,11:17,i've always been her before but my my edgy edgy rebellious years when i,
91,11:23,did eat meat and dairy i think maybe i liked it more than maybe vegan cheesecakes are just different,
92,11:30,i don't know i'm quite picky when it comes to desserts so i don't know i haven't been that impressed by any vegan,
93,11:36,cheesecakes i've had i don't know i've just changed and they're very rich you know,
94,11:43,very very rich huh so for me,
95,11:50,honestly i would put it in i don't know if it goes in the seat here because they're still pretty good,
96,11:57,b or c for me i might put it in the seat here c for cheesecake,
97,12:08,okay okay now to distract you from this crime of commitment against cheesecake,
98,12:13,um apple pie so i love,
99,12:20,pastries i think pastries are the best dessert,
100,12:25,and i think an apple pie counts as pastry because it has the flaky crust and then the sweet filling,
101,12:32,it's the perfect dessert it's perfect although it might not be used here but it's perfect,
102,12:38,i think it goes in the eights here probably i love the pies and pastries the most so,
103,12:46,you're gonna see a lot of them up here i do recognize though that apple pie so a lot of these desserts are carried,
104,12:53,by their accompaniment an apple pie definitely gets carried a little bit by,
105,12:59,ice cream like without the ice cream it's not quite as good and i do think,
106,13:04,that you know you have to take that into consideration [Music] you could say the same chocolate chip,
107,13:10,cookies like they're getting carried by ice cream if you need an ice cream sandwich or i didn't put an ice cream,
108,13:15,sandwich i should have put those or the glass of milk oh my gosh i used to,
109,13:22,not be a milk drinker but recently i've been drinking a lot of oat milk because it's,
110,13:29,so yummy um and i recently had,
111,13:34,i like never drank milk with cookies i don't know why though because i recently,
112,13:39,tried it i had a glass of milk with a chocolate chip cookie for probably the first time since i was,
113,13:45,a child and it was so good perfect pairing,
114,13:51,there's a reason why everyone everyone likes them together,
115,13:59,yeah oat milk is so good i like oatley not sponsored but,
116,14:05,otoli if you want to sponsor me i love your all of your products,
117,14:11,i'll be your spokesperson what could be better than having mother nature herself as your spokesperson,
118,14:18,[Music] um all right pecan pie or maybe you say,
119,14:24,pecan pecan pie pecan pie pecan pecan,
120,14:31,um honestly it's not my favorite pie,
121,14:40,it it might be my least favorite pie,
122,14:45,i don't know it's all right i mean again none of these are bad you know,
123,14:51,but i do think it's worse than cheesecake so in that respect it has to go in the,
124,14:57,detail i think i mean it's not bad it just wouldn't be my first choice for a pie,
125,15:06,i think you can put chocolate in it too it's pretty good with chocolate,
126,15:12,i don't know it's worth a try if you've never had it but yeah,
127,15:17,i'll put it in the deet here [Music] carrot cake,
128,15:23,[Music] carrot cake made it to the thumbnail carrot cake i like i like carrot cake i,
129,15:29,think a lot of people don't like it i like it um i don't remember if i told this story,
130,15:35,before i shared a birthday or whatever my birthday is pretty close to another,
131,15:42,family member in the kieran family so we have in the past shared a birthday party,
132,15:49,um but we each get our own cake for the party and my family member chose,
133,15:57,like a chocolate cake you know classic everybody likes it i chose a carrot cake,
134,16:03,and i think this was the biggest brain move because everybody else at the party,
135,16:08,every other family member wanted to eat the chocolate cake so they all ate the chocolate cake and,
136,16:14,then i had my carrot cake all to myself because everyone chose chocolate instead,
137,16:21,um but also okay you're gonna find this out too i know i mentioned this before but i'm not a big chocolate fan in,
138,16:28,general i like chocolate but i easily get overwhelmed if it's like too much,
139,16:34,chocolate like a lot of people it's like chocolate is the best for me it's like [Music],
140,16:40,chocolate it's not that it's not my favorite,
141,16:47,um like chocolate chip cookies i love cause they're like good amount of chocolate for me if it's like a double,
142,16:54,chocolate chunk cookie you know where the dough is chocolate and it has chocolate chunks in it that's like a,
143,17:00,little too much for me personally i rather have chocolate chip cookie,
144,17:06,but carrot cake i think i'll put it in the beach here also because it's satisfying to have one,
145,17:12,of each so far i think wow it goes in the beach but b is good,
146,17:17,you have to remember b is good i like bb's delicious carrot cake is delicious,
147,17:26,all right ice cream [Music] i don't think there's any point in being,
148,17:32,around the bush ice cream is zest here it has to be it elevates so many other,
149,17:38,desserts it's delicious on its own you can eat it in a cone a waffle cone,
150,17:44,delicious you can make ice cream sandwich you can have a banana split you can have,
151,17:50,it with your apple pie with your peach cobbler with everything,
152,17:56,there's no way it's not ester there's just no way,
153,18:01,also because i didn't separate the flavors we're just going all ice cream,
154,18:06,um we could do an ice cream flavor to your list of our very own but,
155,18:12,when it's just every ice cream all right next up is s'mores s'mores are,
156,18:18,kind of a weird one i don't eat s'mores very often at all,
157,18:26,but i like them a lot i think they have that novelty factor going for them you,
158,18:31,know [Music] like um especially if you have one that's actually roasted on a campfire,
159,18:37,and you get to roast it yourself like get to impale a marshmallow with a stick that you got off the forest floor,
160,18:43,and then roast it until it catches on fire and burns and you try to blow it out and then you throw it away and you,
161,18:49,get a new marshmallow um they're very good and also s'mores flavor things are also,
162,18:56,good like a s'mores cookie or something it's also good,
163,19:02,i don't know if i'm putting the egg here because it's not like my one of my favorite favorite desserts you,
164,19:08,know i don't think i don't know oh i don't know look it's got that nice,
165,19:14,textural variation it's either a or b i think it's above carrot cake but,
166,19:22,i don't know if i'm gonna order them within the tears,
167,19:27,i don't know is it a i might like it as much as apple pie do,
168,19:34,i i don't know i'm thinking like if someone offered me an apple pie or s'more i'd probably take,
169,19:39,this more but is that just because it's more uncommon [Music],
170,19:44,i don't know i'll put it in beads here for now we can always readjust later,
171,19:52,put it hi v heartbeats here are there vegan marshmallows there are,
172,19:59,vegan marshmallows they're i don't know to me they taste identical to regular marshmallows well did you,
173,20:05,know the flavor of marshmallow comes from the plant and then i guess it's pretty easy to,
174,20:11,mimic the texture normal marshmallows have gelatin in them if you did not know,
175,20:16,um [Music] yeah to me they taste,
176,20:22,exactly the same i would not be able to distinguish them,
177,20:28,although they are prime i think they're a lot more expensive as is the case with a lot of things which is unfortunate but,
178,20:37,all right shaved ice i love shaved ice,
179,20:46,i want to put it in the s here is that fair i don't know i love shaved,
180,20:53,ice but i'm very very particular because,
181,21:00,shaved eyes is not a snow cone there is a world of difference between shaved ice,
182,21:05,and snow cone snow cone is crushed ice with a syrup on,
183,21:11,top it's not very good i don't have a snow cone on this list but it would probably go in the fda if i did,
184,21:19,[Music] shave dice is almost fluffy in consistency and then you can put like,
185,21:26,often there's like condensed milk or coconut milk on top and you can put all kinds of toppings on it like fruit and,
186,21:33,even you can put mochi on top which is amazing [Music],
187,21:38,it's very different if you've never had it you should try it is it going est here though,
188,21:46,it's for i don't know because again it has that rarity factor for me like i hardly ever get to eat shaved ice,
189,21:55,so i feel like it's getting boosted by that i don't know if it can go with the,
190,22:01,ah chocolate chip cookie and ice cream though maybe it is eight here but it's like one of my favorite desserts,
191,22:10,um i'll put an egg here,
192,22:15,all right rice crispy treats now this one has chocolate on it because the only picture i could find,
193,22:21,but i don't really like the ones that have chocolate or i prefer without chocolate i mean chocolate is okay but i,
194,22:27,prefer without um i love these they're not that special though,
195,22:32,but i love these i'll put it in beet here,
196,22:37,i think i like them,
197,22:43,only the the homemade ones though the store-bought ones are not as good as the homemade ones,
198,22:51,but also i can't eat the store-bought ones anyways i have to make them myself i think they taste better if you make them yourself,
199,22:58,they're good beets here all right pumpkin pie,
200,23:05,i love pumpkin pie oh especially when it has the whipped,
201,23:10,cream on top oh delicious perfect seasonal,
202,23:16,dessert delicious for me i think it's an atari again it's,
203,23:22,a pie it's pastry so it gets a big boost which makes you think about pecan pie,
204,23:28,how can pecan pie be so low if it's a pie hmm [Music],
205,23:36,yeah a lot of people don't like pumpkin pie but i love pumpkins in general i love pumpkin anything,
206,23:42,pumpkin drink pumpkin well actually last year in the uh,
207,23:50,like autumnal winter season i went a little too crazy and i i would like buy,
208,23:56,anything that had pumpkin spice in it and then it actually wasn't that good like i had some pumpkin spice ice cream,
209,24:02,but it wasn't that good but i was like stuck with it because i kept i kept buying everything i don't know why i'd,
210,24:08,be like oh my gosh pumpkin spice latte at home drink mix i need to buy that,
211,24:14,but then it's like not actually that good but puts you in the festive spirit but pumpkin pie itself is great,
212,24:23,pumpkin pie on its own is wonderful it's the classic everything else isn't,
213,24:28,just trying to be like pumpkin pie i was going in the eightier,
214,24:35,okay red velvet cake i think i might be controversial about this well okay because red velvet cake,
215,24:42,is just chocolate cake with red food coloring and cream cheese frosting which like i guess that is an,
216,24:48,improvement like a cream cheese frosting does make everything better but,
217,24:55,i don't know except actually then i like googled it to make sure that's what it actually is and,
218,25:00,it's actually less chocolatey than chocolate cake it's more like a vanilla cake with a little bit of cocoa powder,
219,25:06,apparently dyed red i don't know i don't know i don't know why it needs to like dye,
220,25:12,itself red to get a sort of identity you know it's like without the red food coloring it has no identity of its own,
221,25:19,so it just has to like pretend that it's red like nothing in it is even making it red you know you have to dye it so like,
222,25:25,why bother like it can't be special on its own so it has to resort to the the food,
223,25:32,coloring i know they could at least put something red in there like,
224,25:37,raspberry i don't know um,
225,25:43,hmm i mean but it's not bad you know it tastes good,
226,25:49,it just means it's more of an identity of its own you know,
227,25:54,hmm wait let's be really controversial let's put it in detail,
228,26:04,funnel cake this is a funny one i don't really know,
229,26:10,where funnel cake goes i mean,
230,26:16,it's certainly all right [Music] i don't i don't i mean it's good,
231,26:22,it's good i don't really eat it ever i don't think i've eaten it since i was,
232,26:28,a kid um what's a funnel cake it's like,
233,26:34,[Music] batter like it's kind of like pancake batter and then you throw it into a deep fryer,
234,26:41,and it turns into this they have it at like fairs,
235,26:46,and maybe like amusement parks and stuff that's like the the context in which you,
236,26:53,would eat it which definitely does help you know because like i think maybe it wouldn't be that impressive if you were,
237,26:58,to serve this at a restaurant or something but like at a carnival you're like oh yeah give me the funnel cake hit me in the,
238,27:05,deep fried everything but i mean it's not bad,
239,27:13,i guess it can go and seat here that's fine i think,
240,27:19,[Music] or a lemon square or lemon bar,
241,27:26,i think i like these i like lemon desserts a lot but i haven't had one of these,
242,27:31,i don't remember the last time i've had one of these i think i like them though,
243,27:37,[Music] i like lemon desserts in general though i think i'll put it in the beet here i,
244,27:44,think b is good [Music],
245,27:50,eight here for you i think i don't know i need to eat one because i haven't had one in a long time,
246,27:56,also i'm not even sure this picture is one i don't know enhance enhance,
247,28:04,when i googled it the one that i googled saw on google looked a lot yummier than this one,
248,28:09,[Music] minecraft it does look like minecraft,
249,28:16,i need some more pixels in my jpeg maybe if i had paid for the premium,
250,28:22,eyestock license we wouldn't have to deal with this pixelated lemon square but here we are,
251,28:30,okay what would it be red pudding i like bread pudding,
252,28:36,again it gets carried a bit by ice cream i wouldn't want to have it without ice,
253,28:42,cream you know it's kind of necessary but it can be really good it's kind of like,
254,28:48,french toast actually maybe that's why i like it it's sort of like french toast,
255,28:53,it's like kind of custardy you know and bread,
256,28:59,but very good with ice cream i don't know i kind of want to put in,
257,29:06,eight here i like bread pudding,
258,29:11,i'm gonna put an eight here it's french toast without the texture yeah that might be true though,
259,29:18,but you already know that french toast is going in s t or sorry for the spoiler,
260,29:25,it can go in the eggs here donuts,
261,29:32,donuts they're going in the est here as well they're another favorite dessert of mine,
262,29:39,i love donuts they're very versatile too just like ice cream i mean i love a classic glazed,
263,29:47,donut that's like mine i don't know if it's even my go-to i like the cream filled ones,
264,29:53,i like lemon ones i mean they're all good,
265,29:58,don't wanna take it around a funnel cake no no no no donuts more pillowy than funnel cake,
266,30:06,funnel cake is just crunchy,
267,30:12,custard filled yes yes oh like a cinnamon sugar one yes,
268,30:18,jelly filled yes all delicious i don't think i've ever,
269,30:24,met a donut i didn't like perfect [Music],
270,30:30,oh i see what's next on our list i'm a little scared okay,
271,30:38,fudge i don't like fudge,
272,30:49,i dislike it more than everything else on the list so far so i think it has to go in left here some of you guys agree,
273,30:56,with me though i thought i would be the only one i don't really like fudge it's too much,
274,31:04,it's way too rich even one bite is too much i would rather,
275,31:09,have one bite of like anything else on this list than one bite of fudge it's too much,
276,31:15,it's just pure it's like eating icing almost which i also i don't really like icing that much we'll get into that,
277,31:21,later fudge f4 fudge [Music],
278,31:29,sorry fudge um jello,
279,31:36,i mean does anyone really like jello that much,
280,31:41,i mean you know it's good i like jello but i don't know i don't love jello,
281,31:48,i don't even like it enough to like buy it you know like compared to all these other desserts jello,
282,31:55,there is an exception though um do you know those they have these in um,
283,32:02,like sometimes you can find them in international grocery stores they're the little jelly cups,
284,32:08,they're not really jello cause they're not refrigerated but they're like those little jelly cups if they come in,
285,32:14,plastic and you like slurp them out they're little little tiny handheld ones,
286,32:21,yeah they can be like a lychee flavored um,
287,32:26,yeah they're just like jelly cups yeah like the agar jelly cups those are really good i love those,
288,32:35,those i cannot buy them because i will eat like all of them i can't stop but then like mango ones,
289,32:44,those are so good yeah but i'm not counting those in here,
290,32:49,so i'm gonna put jello else with the left here,
291,32:56,i didn't even buy jello when i had my mouth surgery my tooth teeth surgery,
292,33:04,i rather have like applesauce,
293,33:10,all right next up cherry pie,
294,33:16,cherry pie is good it's pie,
295,33:22,i don't like it as much as apple pie or pumpkin pie [Music],
296,33:28,but it's very good a cherry turnover is even better,
297,33:35,which is i know i ranked cherries pretty low on the fruit list but,
298,33:42,i don't know they're not my favorite fruit still and that goes with pies too but,
299,33:48,pretty yummy though i mean it's a pie you can't say no to a pie,
300,33:53,i think you can beat here oh we have another pie,
301,33:58,key lime pie key lime pie i can't i don't remember the last time i,
302,34:04,had this hmm,
303,34:11,i might put in seeds here i'm just like imagining eating a key lime pie and i,
304,34:16,don't really want to i don't really want to eat it you know,
305,34:23,and i love lemon desserts [Music] i don't know,
306,34:29,[Music] i don't know why i just don't want to eat it that's covered here not cedar no but i,
307,34:35,know i know it tastes good but i don't know i think it goes and seeds here,
308,34:45,all right the cobbler i guess we're ranking every cobbler,
309,34:51,i don't even know if this is the cobbler and this is the only picture i could find a peach cobbler,
310,34:57,i love the most because peaches are my favorite but i think collars are good in general,
311,35:03,again they're getting carried by ice cream i think they're in the beads here,
312,35:09,which i don't know the b tear is really more like the a tier and then the here is really more like,
313,35:16,the s here and then the ester is really more like the s plus here,
314,35:21,but you know we're grading on a curve so all of our students are exceptional so they're all getting screwed over when we,
315,35:27,curve the exam sorry,
316,35:32,um yeah i think it can go and beat here i think i like it about as much as a cherry pie [Music],
317,35:40,i'd like it more if it had the flaky crust instead of the crumbles you know but it's still very good,
318,35:47,alright next up brownies these might be,
319,35:54,the one exception i have to link very chocolatey things,
320,36:00,i think brownies are really good they have like espresso and they like flaky crust and then they're,
321,36:08,gooey and fudgy on the middle these are like the one chocolate dessert,
322,36:14,that i really like a lot i think eight here,
323,36:21,love a brownie but but but again i'm i like baking myself so i'm a bit,
324,36:28,picky when it comes to baked goods you know like if i get a baked good i want,
325,36:34,it to be better than the one that i can make myself like i always judge it based on that and,
326,36:41,like a lot of times brownies are just chocolate cake and i hate that that it,
327,36:48,should not be just chocolate cake it's not the same the texture is completely different,
328,36:55,so yeah a lot of times you eat them and it's just like chocolate cake but no that's wrong,
329,37:01,that's wrong a brownie is different [Music],
330,37:06,oh boy okay cupcake okay i have problems with cupcakes,
331,37:15,i've got problems with coke cakes i feel like in theory they should be,
332,37:21,they should be great right it's like a cake but it's handheld,
333,37:26,so it's easier to eat you don't even need a fork to eat it right that should be a big bonus for a cupcake but it's,
334,37:33,just the inferior method of eating cake because the ratio is all wrong,
335,37:41,it's too much icing and it's like it's it's supposed to be easy to eat you know,
336,37:47,because it's handheld but it's not easy to eat because you're gonna get icing all over your face when you take a bite,
337,37:52,of it like how are you meant to get your good ratio of icing to,
338,37:58,to cake like when you bite into it you're gonna bite the top first um,
339,38:05,i don't know it's not good it's not good,
340,38:12,i wanna put in an f-tier on principle i mean we're gonna rank the cakes you know,
341,38:17,i'm only ranking the um oh you can't see i'm only ranking the,
342,38:23,the delivery method of a cupcake you know like it can taste great but the ratio is,
343,38:30,all wrong it tries to be easy to eat but it's not even easy to eat not to mention,
344,38:37,like now you have all this paper stuff you know it's like you don't need this [Music],
345,38:43,it's unnecessary waste well they can be quite cute you can get cute little,
346,38:48,wrappers but i know but i also i prefer to eat with like a fork instead,
347,38:56,of my hands because i really don't like messy food oh like i hate it when i'm eating a,
348,39:03,sandwich and all the filling falls out of the sandwich that really bothers me and i don't like,
349,39:10,getting my hands dirty when i eat so i prefer to eat with a fork in general,
350,39:18,you eat a cupcake with a fork no but you eat cake with a fork and cake is just a different form of,
351,39:24,cupcake the superior form of cupcake [Music],
352,39:32,all right speaking of what a vanilla cake,
353,39:37,oh i mean i mean i would rather eat a red velvet,
354,39:43,cake than a vanilla cake it's not bad,
355,39:49,but i don't know it's not that good either,
356,39:55,i would rather eat other flavors of cake you know it's too basic,
357,40:05,it can be good though i don't know it doesn't it i want to put in seeds,
358,40:12,here because i feel like it's very very base line you know but then it feels wrong to have red velvet below it,
359,40:19,but i know maybe red velvet goes below it just because of its identity crisis you know,
360,40:24,[Music] maybe maybe that's fine red velvet the problem,
361,40:29,is not the taste it's the it's the concept like why does it have to be red it's not,
362,40:36,even red okay strawberry shortcake,
363,40:44,here's a real heavy hitter oh,
364,40:50,i kind of want to put in the s here i think i will put it in the st,
365,40:58,i love strawberries you all know strawberry is one of my favorite fruit if not my favorite,
366,41:04,fruit and i love whipped cream especially when it's not too sweet you,
367,41:10,know and then you have a nice cake layer too it's just the perfect dessert it's not,
368,41:15,too sweet it's got delicious strawberries,
369,41:21,there's a lot of different forms of strawberry shortcake though like sometimes the cake is more,
370,41:27,biscuity i've seen it with like biscuits instead of a cake you know,
371,41:33,but i probably prefer it more like a light and airy cake,
372,41:38,oh but we'll put it in the guest here oh yeah our kind of like pound cake too,
373,41:48,or a strawberry cake it is one of my favorite flavors of cake,
374,41:56,and i mean if carrot cake is in the beet here i think strawberry cake should be in the,
375,42:02,eighth here i love strawberry cake i love strawberries,
376,42:08,very yummy this is my classic birthday cake i always have a strawberry cake for my,
377,42:14,birthday if there's no real strawberries in it,
378,42:21,i'm tossing it i agree it needs real strawberries well this one has real strawberries,
379,42:29,so we're ranking it based on that assuming it has real strawberries,
380,42:35,all right next up is sugar cookies,
381,42:40,now these they're bolstered by the fun factor,
382,42:45,rather than the food factor you know like to me these are a pretty basic cookie they do taste good but,
383,42:52,they're not as good as like a chocolate chip cookie for me but they're very fun and they can be very festive you conduct,
384,42:59,and they're fun to decorate i like decorating them with my family,
385,43:04,so i don't know do they get boosted just for that um,
386,43:13,i don't know,
387,43:19,[Music] i think they will go in the seat here,
388,43:25,but they provide an important service to the dessert world we would not be in the same without you,
389,43:31,sugar cookie thank you for existing,
390,43:37,if we're family no they don't go in the aft here okay this is fruit tarts,
391,43:44,i like fruit tarts i love a refreshing fruity dessert,
392,43:50,um i don't think it goes in beats here,
393,43:56,though for me it's not quite eight here i do like it a lot though but it's not,
394,44:02,quite eight here we'll put it in b's here,
395,44:08,yummy though um i used to make fruit tarts a lot,
396,44:15,in high school when i took french class i don't know why i would always make fruit tart i mean i guess because,
397,44:21,they're french i would make them for my classmates and bring them to class,
398,44:27,well we would all like make food together in french class um,
399,44:33,but fruit tart was always the dessert that i would choose,
400,44:41,um okay gingerbread cookies,
401,44:48,these ones they're kind of the same as sugar cookies for me,
402,44:54,i don't know again they're like not i don't know they're not that good,
403,45:00,they're not bad either though the ones that you use for making houses,
404,45:07,are purposefully bad though because those ones are they have to be like especially dried out and hard so,
405,45:14,you can make houses with them like regular gingerbread can be soft but yeah you're right i think it is beef,
406,45:21,here it's not as good as sugar cookie [Music],
407,45:28,i think i have to change them the bgm i think it's making me go crazy,
408,45:36,is it making you guys go crazy too [Music],
409,45:44,maybe that's good though maybe we should be going crazy okay um,
410,45:50,eat angry pgm this one might make you go crazy too,
411,45:59,um,
412,46:04,where are we [Music] oatmeal raisin cookies,
413,46:12,oh okay um i mean i don't like them you probably,
414,46:18,don't like them either okay so you like them you i would always rather be eating,
415,46:25,chocolate chip than oatmeal raisin [Music],
416,46:31,does it go at the end here i mean i feel bad putting in the left here,
417,46:37,because i don't have a vendetta against it like i do with cupcakes and fudge,
418,46:42,but it's just not that good i know maybe i just haven't had good,
419,46:47,ones but it's just not that good,
420,46:54,i don't i agree i don't think they deserve the hate that they get but,
421,47:01,they might still be left here because like i don't know that i guess,
422,47:07,they're about as good as gingerbread cookies i think so they can go underneath here,
423,47:13,they can escape this time,
424,47:19,all right a lemon meringue pie again i like lemon dessert i like pies,
425,47:26,i like lemon meringue more than key lime [Music] but it's not my favorite,
426,47:32,dessert so it's gonna go in the beet here i think,
427,47:43,okay next chocolate cake [Music],
428,47:51,it's also going in the seat here i think chocolate cake is just as basic as,
429,47:56,vanilla cake and it's not as good as brownies,
430,48:02,um especially when it's like chocolate on chocolate it's just too much,
431,48:08,it can be good though there's i don't know chocolate cake is kind of hard to get right,
432,48:14,so a lot of the time it's kind of dry you know which i really like a dry cake i prefer,
433,48:20,a moist cake i don't even hate that worm but you know you want a moist cake,
434,48:27,um a really good chocolate cake is definitely better than sea tear,
435,48:38,ah maybe you can go i'm thinking about the best chocolate cake i've ever had and it can go in the beets here at least,
436,48:46,all right i can go on the beats here beach are getting very busy though,
437,48:53,okay this is the one i had i had to draw myself,
438,48:58,because i couldn't find any photos of it but black and white cookie is my favorite,
439,49:04,cookie it's a very special cookie i don't know i feel like it's kind of,
440,49:12,i think not many people know about a black and white cookie it's not that popular,
441,49:18,yeah a lot of you have never had it i really encourage you to try it they are very,
442,49:24,special um they are kind of like the the dough is more like a cake than a,
443,49:31,cookie and they're also very large and then they're covered in half vanilla,
444,49:37,um icing and then half chocolate ganache so you have the best of both worlds you,
445,49:42,have chocolate and vanilla on top and the texture is so,
446,49:48,good it's like it's like a little bit cakey you know they're soft [Music],
447,49:54,it's a very special cookie is my favorite cookie [Music],
448,50:02,i make them with my mom sometimes because they're they can be hard to find,
449,50:08,you know especially vegan ones a lot of these are just make myself,
450,50:15,but yeah for me esteer they're yummy,
451,50:22,yeah not oreos in fact they're not really similar to oreos at all,
452,50:27,except that they're chocolate and vanilla i guess all right next up is cinnamon rolls,
453,50:34,cinnamon rolls are another one of my favorite desserts of all time i love cinnamon rolls they're easy ester,
454,50:42,for me they're definitely one of my favorite desserts,
455,50:48,of all time i love cinnamon rolls also they're really hard to make because,
456,50:53,they're um raised so you have to proof them like two times it takes like hours to,
457,51:00,make them oh so it's real production,
458,51:05,but they're so yummy [Music] again i'm not too interested in,
459,51:11,chocolaty chocolatey stuff most of the time so cinnamon roll is really good,
460,51:17,big fan one of my favorites,
461,51:22,all right we're getting we're getting to the bottom of the getting we're getting close to,
462,51:30,everything i have pudding,
463,51:36,i don't think pudding is that good i mean it's okay it's better than jello,
464,51:42,[Music] i don't know it's not that good,
465,51:47,[Music] i know i'm funny i do like um also i think we're just talking we're,
466,51:54,not talking flan or flying flan not talking flan we're just talking,
467,51:59,just like american pudding um,
468,52:07,i do like the ones that are chocolate they're like a layer of chocolate and then a layer of vanilla and then a layer,
469,52:13,of chocolate i used to eat those all the time as a kid and i would try to scrape off the chocolate layer,
470,52:19,and eat that and then and then eat the vanilla layer separately and then eat the chocolate,
471,52:24,layer separately,
472,52:29,so they're pretty good but i don't know,
473,52:35,i just don't think it's that special [Music] for me it's going in the deeds here,
474,52:42,[Music] sorry i'm pudding,
475,52:47,all right next up we have creme brulee i don't really know how to rate this,
476,52:55,creme brulee like i feel like it should be really good,
477,53:01,i don't know i like can't i have had it before but only like a couple times,
478,53:07,i don't know i'll definitely eat it but,
479,53:13,i know i like the crunchy top,
480,53:20,it just feels fancy which makes me feel like it's it it's i want to rate it higher than it is just,
481,53:27,because it's fancy you know popular kieran makes this sometimes,
482,53:33,because well i've said before he's very interested in cooking although my mom is more the baker and,
483,53:41,papa kieran is the cook the chef i should say,
484,53:46,um but he likes these kind of fancy things like a creme brulee where he has to bring out like the kitchen blow torch,
485,53:53,you know that kind of thing yeah yeah he has the cool torch well he loves those kind of kitchen gadget,
486,54:00,things [Music],
487,54:06,he probably does like playing with fire um,
488,54:11,[Music] so i don't i don't i don't know where to rate it i really don't have any idea i,
489,54:17,think it can we can just stick it in the seat here see for creme brulee,
490,54:23,i think i don't know though i mean yeah okay what this can go,
491,54:28,or beats here did i say c b is here b t or c to your b tier,
492,54:35,b maybe b for brulee,
493,54:40,it goes in both because c and b [Music],
494,54:46,okay okay next up is danish which to be honest okay first of all i,
495,54:52,don't know if this is even a danish but it was the closest picture i could find i don't even know it really counts as a,
496,54:57,danish i feel like it's kind of a broad term but in my mind a danish is like a pastry,
497,55:05,and then it has a cream cheese filling and then it has some kind of like fruit on the,
498,55:10,top and then like some icing on top too um,
499,55:17,and if that's what it is then these are also one of my favorite desserts of all time,
500,55:24,except i can never find a vegan one so i haven't had one in,
501,55:29,many years which is very sad but i used to eat the one,
502,55:35,at panera all the time maybe you guys have had that one,
503,55:44,um but it's really yummy [Music],
504,55:52,so it's going in the ester one of my favorites,
505,55:59,[Music] um [Music],
506,56:05,all right next up peanut butter cookies,
507,56:10,these are good i love peanut butter however they can be very dry,
508,56:17,they can be so dry like the driest thing you've ever eaten,
509,56:25,i feel like they lose some points for that yeah you need milk they can make your,
510,56:30,mouth so dry but they're good i like how they're soft i love peanut butter,
511,56:36,i think they're going in the beets here for butter b for butter,
512,56:41,[Music] they're good and they're fun to make i like doing the little fork impression,
513,56:47,um sometimes when i make these i'll put jam on them or i'll do like thumb print kind of like,
514,56:54,a thumb print cookie but do like peanut butter instead since like a peanut butter and jelly cookie it also makes it a little less dry,
515,57:01,because you have the jam but they're good,
516,57:09,all right i do love peanut butter i love pbs,
517,57:14,next is mochi which is also one of my favorite desserts of all time,
518,57:21,we have a lot of favorite desserts of all time don't we,

536,59:16,which is pretty amazing um that we were i mean our teacher was really chill and,
537,59:22,there were very few of us in the class so we and she had a kitchen in her,
538,59:28,classroom so we could just cook during class and then we make french food and we since um,
539,59:34,it's our cultural education,

541,59:48,[Music] okay,
542,59:54,next up is snickerdoodle they're pretty good they're all right,
543,1:00:01,they would not be my first choice of cookie but again like i'm not going to turn down a snickerdoodle who would turn,
544,1:00:08,down a snickerdoodle um i think i'll put them in the seat,
545,1:00:13,here though is that too mean i don't know the beach here is too big,
546,1:00:19,too much in the beach here so it has to go in the seat here,
547,1:00:24,oh no [Music] my chat has crushed come back,
548,1:00:31,come back they're just fancy sugar cookies they kind of are,
549,1:00:38,i like cinnamon sugar flavored things though you guys are back i can see you again,
550,1:00:46,i can see all of your food opinions all right we're almost done,
551,1:00:54,this is about everything we have just a couple more,
552,1:01:00,just yield dessert breakfast although we also had cinnamon,
553,1:01:06,roll and donut which i don't know how can a cinnamon roll be breakfast,
554,1:01:14,i mean again no judgment but like come on come on,
555,1:01:20,oh but i don't know i think i don't like the idea that you have to eat specific foods at breakfast,
556,1:01:28,i think you should eat whatever you want for breakfast like i like to eat fried rice for,
557,1:01:35,breakfast um and i like maybe i want to eat the,
558,1:01:42,full full american breakfast for dinner sometime,
559,1:01:49,okay french toast i mean you already know i love french toast,
560,1:01:54,one of my favorite foods of all time not even just desserts one of my favorite foods of all time,
561,1:02:00,i love a french toast it goes in the ester it must,
562,1:02:06,[Music] it's fun to make too and and,
563,1:02:11,it serves a purpose because you can you can use it to make your stale bread,
564,1:02:17,delicious you know so it's like economical and delicious,
565,1:02:24,and it cuts down on waste and it's perfect and it's bread i love,
566,1:02:32,bread okay pancakes pancakes are good,
567,1:02:38,they're not as good as french toast and they're not as good as waffles i think,
568,1:02:43,oh this is the endless dumb pancakes versus waffles but i think waffles are just better because they have more,
569,1:02:49,texture you know they have the crisp and fluffy texture i do like pancakes though,
570,1:02:57,so i think it goes like this i think waffles go in the interior and pancakes go in the beets here,
571,1:03:05,there's so much in the beet here again they're just like a vessel you,
572,1:03:10,know for whatever you put on top of it,
573,1:03:18,okay i think this is our list,
574,1:03:24,how do we feel about this we can read through it in the s tier we,
575,1:03:29,have in no particular order i've not ordered them chocolate chip cookies ice cream donuts,
576,1:03:37,strawberry shortcake black and white cookies cinnamon rolls danishes,
577,1:03:42,mochi and french toast that sounds right to me these are all my favorite desserts,
578,1:03:50,yup yup these are the best ones for me to me,
579,1:03:56,best desserts no banana bread oh,
580,1:04:03,i almost put banana bread i know i'm just going to rant about how,
581,1:04:09,how waffles and pancakes are not breakfast but i'm like wait but banana bread is breakfast,
582,1:04:16,banana bread it can almost be healthy,
583,1:04:22,if you make it with like oats and whole wheat flour,
584,1:04:28,and don't put too much sugar in it it can almost be breakfast healthy breakfast [Music],
585,1:04:37,banana bread's yummy though i like banana bread all right in the ain't here we have,
586,1:04:43,apple pie shaved ice pumpkin pie bread pudding brownies strawberry cake crepes and,
587,1:04:51,waffles that sounds pretty good too i almost feel like strawberry cake and shaved ice,
588,1:04:57,could be bumped up a layer though but i think it's good,
589,1:05:03,i mean every dessert is yummy except for um [Music],
590,1:05:09,yeah just don't need to look at those um beets here,
591,1:05:15,we have s'mores carrot cake rice krispies treat,
592,1:05:20,rice crispy i always call them rice crispy treats but the name is rice,

594,1:05:31,lemon square cherry pie cobbler fruit tart lemon meringue pie chocolate cake,
595,1:05:37,creme brulee peanut butter cookies and pancakes yeah that feels pretty good to me,
596,1:05:44,too and then the seat here cheesecake,

598,1:05:56,snickerdoodle looks good to me,
599,1:06:02,deets here pecan pie red velvet cake red velvet's probably too low but,
600,1:06:09,you know identity crisis gingerbread cookies oatmeal raisin,
601,1:06:14,cookies and pudding why is pudding there i want to put pudding lower no pudding is not that bad,
602,1:06:20,i just don't know why i don't want to see it with all the others pudding feels like it should be hanging out with the,
603,1:06:26,fudge and the jello but it's not that bad,
604,1:06:33,um then we have in the aft here fudge jello and cupcakes,
605,1:06:43,we can almost fit everything in the screen except we're missing a few here,
606,1:06:49,[Music] i think this is pretty good,
607,1:06:56,this is my list my definitive desserts to your list there you have it,
608,1:07:03,how did i do how did this make you feel on a scale of one two uh through your computer monitor across,
609,1:07:10,the wall or better or worse than the fruits and vegetables [Music],
610,1:07:15,i feel like this was less controversial than the fruits and vegetables but i don't know,
611,1:07:23,is it because all desserts are good is it because our brains are chemically wired to fine sugar and fat delicious,
612,1:07:33,i mean i still i think vegetables are still delicious too vegetables are delicious too,
613,1:07:38,[Music] but you know they don't they don't activate your dopamine receptors the,
614,1:07:44,same way um [Music] ice cream does or donut [Music],
615,1:07:52,effort velvet gang the ironic thing is this just makes me want to eat a red velvet cake,
616,1:07:57,oh i really wanted to try them a,
617,1:08:03,what is it called tres leches cake i've never had one i want to make one i wanna try it,
618,1:08:11,it has like a three milks right like condensed milk,
619,1:08:17,and evaporated milk and,
620,1:08:23,regular milk i don't know [Music] i want to make it,
621,1:08:29,it sounds hard to make though,
622,1:08:36,pretty soggy i want to try it i need to see for myself [Music],
623,1:08:45,it is very not a vegan so i'd have to make it myself but that goes for most of the things on this list,
624,1:08:52,i think if you're a vegan who likes desserts like me you kind of just have to learn to bake,
625,1:08:59,if you if you want to try stuff like um a black and white cookie like i think it's hard enough to find a regular,
626,1:09:06,version but it's okay it's a good skill to have it's an easy way to make friends because,
627,1:09:12,you can just bring them baked goods and everyone loves when you bring them baked goods right,
628,1:09:21,where'd i put flaunt i don't know i don't know if i've had flan,
629,1:09:27,i don't know i know i've watched videos of people,
630,1:09:32,eating giant flaws [Music] truffles are tiramisu yeah i should have,
631,1:09:40,put jeremy sue on here tiramisu,
632,1:09:45,probably goes in,
633,1:09:50,probably the eight here that's it i don't know i haven't had it in a long time,
634,1:09:56,um yeah,
635,1:10:04,macarons macarons i've also never had well actually i tried to make them,
636,1:10:11,with the help of mama kieran but macarons are really hard to make if,
637,1:10:17,you've ever they're like the most difficult thing to make i think the most difficult,
638,1:10:23,dessert to make they're very hard to make,
639,1:10:28,um i know i think we didn't really get them 100 right because you have to get them to have,
640,1:10:34,feet that's what it's called sorry that probably sounds really weird but they have feet that's like,
641,1:10:41,hold on i can show you we're in clip studio paint sorry to,
642,1:10:46,break your immersion on my my copyright free tear maker um,
643,1:10:53,a macaron is like this right,
644,1:11:00,i was smiling this this just looks like a hamburger but this part,
645,1:11:07,[Music] right here like a different texture,
646,1:11:14,right here and this is the feet it's called the feet and it's really,
647,1:11:20,hard to get them to have feet but also they can often be hollow on the inside,
648,1:11:26,ours ended up being hollow on the inside of the shell they still taste good in my opinion but,
649,1:11:32,yeah we need to try again they're really hard to make,
650,1:11:38,and get perfectly correct anyway now i want to bake stuff,
651,1:11:46,i won't bake any food,
652,1:11:52,all right but but but i think that will be it for today that is the end of our tier list thank you for watching,
