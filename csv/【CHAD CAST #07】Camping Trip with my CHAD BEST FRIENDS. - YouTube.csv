10,5:01,away shall we you'll get him eventually you'll get him eventually you guys like,
11,5:07,the little fire we had built out there yes it's a bit far away so I'm a bit chilly,
12,5:15,that's fine that's fine we've done each other we're inside the tent we're fine that is true that is true and we've got,
13,5:22,our little blankets yeah which means that we might cause a fire hazard because we're leaving the,
14,5:27,fire unattended that is usually yeah fine yeah how are you guys doing welcome,
15,5:34,back to another episode of chat doing not bad actually um we're supposed to kind of do this a,
16,5:39,bit earlier but schedule things didn't really like work out too much so we ended up moving it to tonight the night,
17,5:45,of nights where we didn't really have much going on and it worked out for the better I think because I was looking,
18,5:51,forward to this all day today was one of the weirdest days of my life,
19,5:58,it's like I go out of my house for like one second and then it's like I Doom myself to run into like a million weird,
20,6:04,things and I say a million but there was really only two that kind of like freaked me out a little bit are you,
21,6:10,chomping on something bae you want to tell people what you're chomping on first we we prepared in celebration of um Chad,
22,6:18,Camp we've prepared some camp food um you know to really I mean I am in the,
23,6:23,backyard and you know definitely there's bugs everywhere I'm in nature but you know to really have that camp spirit I,
24,6:30,have some food a maid very lazy nachos,
25,6:35,um and it's really good is there such a thing as non-lazy nachos no I'm not I'm like actual nachos nachos right,
26,6:42,that you like order from restaurants and stuff and then you have my nachos that I put in the microwave okay I think it's a,
27,6:48,bit different oh you're making me really want to talk around five minutes taco rice is delicious,
28,6:54,you don't know what taco rice is no you he then um taco rice is uh it's Taco with,
29,7:03,rice basically you take the ingredients of a taco you dump it on top of rice isn't,
30,7:09,that just the burrito bowl no it's a little different because it's white rice it's called taco rice,
31,7:16,hold on a second wait I thought the ingredients of tacos and burritos pretty much the same,
32,7:24,kind of I feel like there's more rice in the actual um like the actual taco rice,
33,7:30,you crack like an egg over it sometimes and like you can eat it with chips my,
34,7:35,favorite has kind of a lot of vegetables in it too in my image okay that's what we call it okay that's a burrito bowl to,
35,7:42,me I see I see yeah I thought taco rice was a Japanese thing but maybe it's not,
36,7:48,like it is because I think it kind of is,
37,7:58,I see I see ladies have for Chad Kim s'mores,
38,8:04,so I went that was one of the reasons why I left my house today so I could get materials to make s'mores but you know,
39,8:10,it's Japan so it's impossible to find things to make s'mores especially especially if it's uh Natsu I meant to,
40,8:18,say summer oh my God if it sucks in such a in such a Gaijin accent to Natsu,
41,8:24,um he's trying to say nuts idiot no um I mean summertime because in summertime,
42,8:30,it's harder to find marshmallows but you guys I waited to tell I waited to tell you this on stream I found not only,
43,8:37,regular mushrooms but I also found mushrooms um oh marshmallows,
44,8:45,no it's mushrooms what I don't know why mushrooms I'm thinking about the mushrooms are delicious but they are,
45,8:52,really good I am a big fan marshmallows not only regular marshmallows but I also found don't don't you laugh at me I also,
46,9:00,found uh dajirling tea marshmallow is that how you pronounce it,
47,9:05,I have no clue what the jewelry I don't know in Japanese they pronounce,
48,9:12,it but I don't know Darjeeling I thought it was Darjeeling,
49,9:17,no don't trust me don't trust me I don't know what I don't know what what they're what it's called how it's pronounced,
50,9:24,yes and I also found coffee marshmallows too for Bae I thought you might be,
51,9:30,interested in that bay coffee marshmallows yeah I don't think I've ever seen coffee marshmallows,
52,9:36,before what the heck yeah I haven't either I'm about to try them,
53,9:41,let's go microwave and I couldn't find anything,
54,9:47,[Laughter] what do you say oh no no microwave,
55,9:54,s'mores is we have a fire right back there but I don't want to roast them instead I want to use the mini microwave that I brought,
56,10:01,using the power of newbie Rays um uh I am eating country mom because I,
57,10:08,couldn't find anything that was close to camper and like did in the convenience store nearby um but I have a chocolate country mom,
58,10:15,cookies which is very uh kind of catfish uh I also have chocolate covered chips,
59,10:20,that if you put it close to the fire the chocolate would become really droopy and,
60,10:26,yes like melted chocolate which I haven't opened yet but I will eat Iris,
61,10:32,don't tell me that they didn't have trail mix I think you just didn't want to eat trail mix,
62,10:38,no no I didn't see any trail mix nearby nope nope nope I don't see anything like,
63,10:44,that is that a fib or no I I really didn't I didn't trail mix,
64,10:50,didn't didn't really come up in my brain what else oh Cornell is walking around the,
65,10:55,convenience store now I guess that's true some people don't really think about trail mix when it comes to like stuff to take on like a hike and stuff,
66,11:02,like that but I always used to think about trail mix like awesome raisins chocolate chips and nuts [Music],
67,11:09,yeah I was gonna say the first time and only time I ever went hiking slash camping in my brain I was like oh my God,
68,11:16,I'm gonna be so cool with my trail mix and then I made it and then I didn't eat it and then I came back and then I still,
69,11:22,didn't eat it no ladies well I can't totally fall it's kind of,
70,11:29,nasty I've only had trail mix one time when we had to like um,
71,11:36,have like this we had this thing this Pro what do you call this it was like a,
72,11:41,out camping out sort of thing where we were supposed to like it was kind of like community service where we're,
73,11:46,supposed to pretend that like oh this is how people feel when when they don't,
74,11:52,have that much food oh I see I see yeah yeah and then like basically feel how it,
75,11:59,is it was something I had to do in school and like um basically like we had,
76,12:06,oatmeal for breakfast that was the first time I had oatmeal before and,
77,12:12,um I hated it it feels good it's yummy if you get the,
78,12:17,sugary strawberry ones the Quaker Oats mm-hmm yeah wow I'm sorry to hear that I,
79,12:24,mean to be to be fair though yeah things with oats aren't really the most tasty I talk all this hype about trail mix but,
80,12:31,you know you really just pick out the raisins and the chocolate and eat those and throw the nuts,
81,12:36,yeah the nut Snickers and I go to trail mix as well,
82,12:42,oh gosh it's like mine is pretty much it's pretty much oatmeal right yeah,
83,12:48,isn't it with like raisins and chocolate it's a mix of things yeah nuts like almonds and uh,
84,12:55,peanuts and whatever you want really you can kind of like mix it up and like make it like customize it and stuff like that,
85,13:01,so oh I see I see yep but uh I'm gonna,
86,13:06,eat another s'more real quick because these are so delicious they like explode in the microwave so,
87,13:12,quick though like you can only microwave them for five seconds before like they start to blow up real bit oh my God it's,
88,13:17,stuck to my fingers okay ah this is bad ah um oh no okay um hold on we were just we,
89,13:24,were talking um before the stream was started before the stream started because Iris was like I couldn't find,
90,13:29,any canned food and I was like bruh just just get some Ramen Ramen is cup of,
91,13:35,noodles is cat food it's true but then a lot of people don't like I guess you don't automatically think of like,
92,13:41,instant noodles as a cat food and then I called it instant noodles is Smart Camp food if you're on a spot you'll bring,
93,13:48,like cup noodles to Camp it is true though I feel like cup noodles is definitely a Cancun especially in Japan,
94,13:53,because it's just so easy you just put hot water in it and it's done yeah and you get a whole meal,
95,13:59,and it's high in calories so you know so you don't have to worry about not,
96,14:05,having enough calories to live out the day that was literally a YouTube account too I'm pretty sure yep oh yeah I,
97,14:12,remember that I feel like Japanese camping is like so much different than people's perception of like American,
98,14:18,camping like I've been on quite a few at least with like students I've been on a couple student camping trips and I've,
99,14:25,only been to cab once at school too that was like fifth grade yeah it's like a school thing yeah I mean,
100,14:32,it was interesting because like the projects were usually like make a curry together and who can make which group,
101,14:38,can make the best curry rice or like which group can like do a good barbecue or something like that we'd have like um,
102,14:43,like a Japanese style barbecue yeah so like a lot of campsites will have just,
103,14:49,like barbecue grills set up um for like Yakiniku style like Japanese style barbecue so like not like the hot,
104,14:56,dogs and like cheeseburgers you guys are imagining but like slices of meat like Yakiniku style uh vegetables mushrooms,
105,15:03,greens and stuff like that it's really awesome very delicious oh my God yeah we would make curry together as well in,
106,15:09,groups and stuff like that mm-hmm I remember um for breakfast they would split us up,
107,15:15,into like groups of like three people per and they would tell us to make our own breakfast and they told us to bring,
108,15:21,eggs and bacon and the person who was in charge of bacon in my group brought turkey bacon instead and it was it was,
109,15:28,like we're like this is regular Bakery we started cooking it looks it looked and tasted so different from everyone,
110,15:34,else I was like what the hell's wrong with this bacon it was a turkey it was disgusting,
111,15:39,I don't like it all right I didn't like it that's fine that's fine you didn't like how dare you like something I don't,
112,15:45,like Iris I should strangle you right now I can understand that it's like if,
113,15:50,you're expecting normal bacon and then you get turkey bacon yeah just like it and then I was just like,
114,15:56,it's okay I'm just gonna wait for dinner because dinner is gonna be great but then no dinner ended up being chilly and,
115,16:01,I didn't like chili wait what actually is good Iris I'm gonna kill her I'm kidding I don't,
116,16:09,like the bean I don't like the beans and the chili no you can pick them out like,
117,16:14,yeah I just took them out pretty much pretty much I pick up,
118,16:19,I forgot I make it into meat sauce instead without the without the beans,
119,16:25,I see man you're making me want to order like taco rice and like chili and like like little chips like tortilla chips to,
120,16:32,dips tomorrow's dinner tomorrow's dinner oh but you know like one good thing,
121,16:38,about um oh sorry this might not be something I should talk about while you guys are eating oh oh let me eat my last s'more,
122,16:45,really quick hold on I got I got this oh my God,
123,16:50,three they're little huh well you guys are gonna be hearing crunching throughout,
124,16:56,the entire two hours oh well are you a slow eater like Iris,
125,17:03,no I'm a very fast eater but hey where are you flying shots at me,
126,17:08,I got a bone to pick with you not a turkey bacon at dinner in 10 minutes today,
127,17:16,but I'm trying to balance eating and also talking and also listening you're very difficult [Music],
128,17:23,um but what were we talking about oh yeah yeah Iris I have finished my mouthful you may now speak yes okay is,
129,17:29,it okay yeah go for it um okay so um the fact that I wasn't able to eat much during Camp wasn't really that wasn't,
130,17:36,wasn't actually a bad thing because the only bathrooms that they had at Camp were the portable ones and you guys know,
131,17:42,how the portable bathrooms are right and that was the first time in my life I had to use a portable bathroom and so,
132,17:49,basically I didn't want to use it and I think the first person who would use it would have a pleasant time because,
133,17:55,you're the first person to use it right but um afterwards it just you know it piles up so,
134,18:01,um basically basically what I did was I held in,
135,18:06,everything,
136,18:12,it was it was a it was a one night a two-day uh camping trip so,
137,18:18,um I held it and and then at the very last like hour so right before we went,
138,18:23,to uh went back to the school bus I had to I had I had to I not not not not not,
139,18:30,like it was just um just I had to do an idol meeting,
140,18:35,um but anyways that's [ __ ] money,
141,18:41,and it was so bad like it was like it I never I never want to use I know no no,
142,18:48,no and not number two guys no no no no no no no some people in chat were like number two no thankfully I didn't eat,
143,18:54,that much so yeah yeah I think okay I thought you yeah I was about to say like,
144,19:00,are you are you literally telling your fans about the time you had explosive diarrhea,
145,19:06,bro like I said I didn't eat much so so,
146,19:14,literally nothing nothing nothing so no number two but but I couldn't hold in,
147,19:20,everything else so basically yeah it smells it was so the smell was,
148,19:27,horrible and ever since then I decided never to play at a park for too long because they have those at parks too or,
149,19:34,never to go a place that doesn't have a bathroom and I hate and that basically um cut in stone the fact that I don't,
150,19:41,really like camping I mean imagine uh imagine how the drivers of the honey wagons feel do you know what a Honey,
151,19:47,Wagon is no I don't what what's a Honey Wagon uh a Honey Wagon is basically,
152,19:53,um like the the Honey Wagon truck is the truck that exists to uh basically take,
153,19:58,care of everything that the portable toilets uh procure inside of them so,
154,20:03,like especially if you're like on the set of a film or something like that and go hey there's the Honey Wagon driving,
155,20:08,by it's the truck and it's a truck filled with [ __ ] from the port of from the portable toilets because it's got,
156,20:15,well the contents I'm anyway so yeah yeah that's yeah it's the Honey Wagon,
157,20:20,I've never had so much difficulty swallowing food before [Applause] [Laughter],
158,20:29,I I restarted it I restarted it what no no no I kind of did I kind of did but I,
159,20:36,mean uh back to camping experience I've only been like camping camping in tents,
160,20:42,like once um and it was also a hike so it wasn't any fun activities it was literally just,
161,20:47,hike and Camp I think it's tiring though yeah oh I it,
162,20:54,was the first time I've ever went it was the last time I ever went it was like it was so sad um it was like imagine baby baby rat,
163,21:01,carrying like a 13 kilogram bag um hiking,
164,21:06,goodbye yeah distinctly like towards the end because it was like a two-day hike,
165,21:13,um towards the end we were climbing up something it was kind of steep and I could feel the force of gravity and I,
166,21:20,nearly fell backwards um thankfully there was someone behind me who just pushed me and I was like you,
167,21:26,have saved my life thank you so much oh what a Chad yeah that was very kind of,
168,21:31,them yeah but like speaking of like the the the the the bathroom incident,
169,21:38,um I remember I strategically woke up at,
170,21:45,like four in the morning to go to the bathroom so I'd be the first one to use it but I just realized that all my friends were,
171,21:52,all so smart because like at 4am you could just see like groups of people just going to the bathroom trying to be,
172,21:58,the first one to go but it would just be useless and we all just got it before in,
173,22:04,the morning anyway it was sad it's a little bit I mean,
174,22:10,yeah if you want to go to a quality camp they don't have portable toilets they,
175,22:15,have they should have their own plumbing system you know but those cost money for people,
176,22:23,where'd you guys go [Music] you guys are talking and I can't hear you,
177,22:29,where'd they go they left me I can't oh I know why,
178,22:38,I left them back oh she's back oh she actually left,
179,22:45,okay that was very strange no no my sorry my manager asked me to join into,
180,22:50,like a really important group that like it like popped up and I like joined it and I was like okay and then I went in,
181,22:56,there and then I was like where'd everyone go because I didn't know it was gonna take me and throw me into the voice Channel anyway anyway hi no,
182,23:05,problem I'm back um she came back with milk yeah oh that,
183,23:10,was very nicely tied we thought that was I thought we thought you ran away from the toilet oh I mean that too I guess I,
184,23:18,I took all of the viewers with me I pulled them away from your nightmares,
185,23:24,oh God it's okay everything's fine um but yeah Camp is I don't know there's,
186,23:31,like the whole setting up the tent thing is also I was the useless one in the team when,
187,23:36,when making the tent like they were they would have the poles and the and the yeah the the cloth part they'd be like,
188,23:43,oh put it together like this and I'm like I don't know what to do so I would have my other friends help pretty much,
189,23:49,build it for me and I was just like I don't know they were just like okay I was just hold on to this just hold on to,
190,23:54,this that would be this I would just be yeah just hold on to it don't do anything just hold on to it because I,
191,24:00,don't know how to do anything yep man that's interesting I just I was the one who was like hammering the the pegs into,
192,24:06,the ground nice well all right girl body strength,
193,24:14,man that's so adorable I feel like I've been camping a ton of times actually but I've never camped in a tent before it's,
194,24:21,always been cabins I wish I had it I wish I camped in the,
195,24:27,cabin yeah they're pretty cool yeah yeah I think like I have been on with cabins,
196,24:33,are really fun though I'm pretty sure the camp place that I've been to had cabins too but they were for like the,
197,24:41,upper grade schoolers like we were like the fifth grade the little kids so we had the tents meanwhile like the 8th,
198,24:48,graders got the cabins but yeah it just reminds me it's like even we got the,
199,24:53,cabins it's literally just a room with like bunk beds and then we would walk past where like um where the where the,
200,24:58,where the teachers would stay and it's like a fully decked out like that ain't,
201,25:04,right no room and we're like what you guys get a TV in the freaking Kettle and we have,
202,25:10,mattress that's it just mattress,
203,25:16,I've never slept on a bunk bed before that sounds so cool no it's not that,
204,25:22,good yeah of course we would ask for the top right yeah what if the what if it,
205,25:27,you know it breaks down and breaks and you die yeah that's why you would always stay at the top so you're not the one,
206,25:35,um unless the ceiling is low then the top buns suck oh yeah yeah that's true hit,
207,25:42,your head every single time yeah most cabins are usually not that high anyway like the ceiling so top bugs suck bottom,
208,25:51,bug suck everything just sucked yeah bunk beds are not the best I remember when I went camping a long time ago,
209,25:57,everything about it was bad because uh basically my school went on a camping trip and I loved the camp that we went,
210,26:03,to so much that I begged I begged Mama Mori um to get me and little sister reap to,
211,26:08,go to the camp like officially you know like um for the summer instead of during the school year and so we went to this,
212,26:15,camp and it was it was Insanity um I actually I recall that I went um,
213,26:22,when I when I went I felt so alone because I distinctly remember being in the middle bunk in the middle of the,
214,26:28,cabin and I recall that I had like I had like a bunch of like manga with me like,
215,26:34,Oren High School Host Club and like girls the point be like what's,
216,26:40,that I'd be like manga they'd be like I don't know what that is I'm like it's Japanese comics and they'd be like okay and they like wouldn't talk to me,
217,26:49,so it's fall in love [Music],
218,26:54,so I just kind of I kind of rolled with it but to be honest I actually only was at the camp for um for two days uh the,
219,27:02,first day that I was there um we all played this huge like game and somebody accidentally hit a huge swarm,
220,27:09,of killer bees and they came out and stung about 30 kids including me on the,
221,27:14,finger but some kids got stung on the face which was bad um and I was fine I took it like a champ because it was just,
222,27:20,my finger I was like holy [ __ ] that really hurt and then I went to go to the the medical area the the med cabin and,
223,27:27,there was just a line of like 20 kids and I was like jeez oh my God holy moly,
224,27:33,the counselor snuffed him out though eventually that was the first night the second night I got appendicitis and had,
225,27:39,to leave so that was my Camp story oh my goodness that reminded me so like,
226,27:47,I I said that I only had one Camp experience in my life right but I was,
227,27:52,supposed to have technically two Camp experiences but the second one got canceled because it was my sixth grade,
228,28:00,um camp and basically what happened was that um right before we like we were,
229,28:05,going on the school bus to go to the campsite someone mentioned that they lost their wallet and then automatically,
230,28:12,for some reason the teachers thought that someone stole that person's wallet and so came the came the whole oh eggs,
231,28:20,yes um pretty much someone we have to find,
232,28:26,out who stole Blah's wallet otherwise we're not getting on the school bus like,
233,28:32,everyone is not gonna go to Camp unless someone speaks up so if one person's fault,
234,28:37,ruins everyone's experience and I don't even know what happened to that in the,
235,28:44,end I don't know what happened to that in the end someone even actually stole a wall to,
236,28:51,begin with I don't know but because of that we couldn't go to Camp yeah oh man,
237,29:00,what do you call that like you know when when it's just one person's fault but it they decide to punish everyone all right,
238,29:07,I don't know is there a word for that in Japanese there's a word called,
239,29:13,yeah I don't think there's a word in English for that oh yeah but yeah,
240,29:18,I'm gonna write that down I want to use it someday punishment I guess yeah Collective punishment,
241,29:26,that sounds so so scary in English,
242,29:33,Among Us stop saying Among Us I know oh my God that really we were all,
243,29:40,so bummed out and like we were like with our backpacks and with our camping bags,
244,29:46,and everything in Reading you're like school like that no I know it's not and,
245,29:53,everyone's like just was so upset and and then yeah that was my last,
246,29:59,ever um almost Camp almost Camp experience,
247,30:06,oh and that was the year that we were able to use the cabins too but no no,
248,30:16,I'm thinking about like cabin camping is like if your tools you know the first,
249,30:21,night you get there you're probably really tired you just like sleep on the bunk bed mattress and whatever but I remember my friends and I after the,
250,30:28,first night we just pull all the mattresses off the bunk beds and just lie them in the middle of the room and,
251,30:33,we'll just have like a giant like slumber party type situation and we all bring we had all brought snacks and,
252,30:39,stuff like that's the true essence of camp but and like you would like you know talk and like you know stuff all,
253,30:45,night because because it cabins it's kind of soundproof I mean everyone else was doing it as well so like you can't sound proof sound because they're just,
254,30:51,so much sound and the teachers are always on like the other side of Camp because they're in their freaking Motel looking ass rooms right yeah,
255,30:58,that one time we had 10 to Camp tent camping is very different because there is no soundproof at all and because it,
256,31:06,was a hike everyone was so tired but there was one one group one group who decided no we're,
257,31:13,gonna stay up all night and we're gonna talk we're gonna talk [ __ ] about everybody and forget that everyone else can hear us in the middle of the night,
258,31:20,Hooligans fool again tenth camping is that we're all together even the teachers right so,
259,31:27,yeah everyone could hear them wait the teachers they took the teachers don't tell you guys to sleep like they would,
260,31:32,make rounds and they would light their flashlights and and shine it into the tents seeing if we're sleeping or not,
261,31:42,so like they gave them a couple warnings in the end they just gave up and then so they were like you know or like talking,
262,31:49,like Mad Mad Dog about everything and everyone and everyone else was like,
263,31:55,and then Karma thank everything that her has power in this world they're 10,
264,32:00,collapsed oh yeah karma that's what happens,
265,32:08,gonna hit you man I tell you what amazing thing I'd ever I've ever,
266,32:14,witnessed in my life it was great I mean absolutely glorious they did,
267,32:20,then cause a lot of noise trying to figure out how to read make the chocolate that's fine true I mean to be,
268,32:27,honest I could I could sleep peacefully hearing them struggling outside maybe that's just because I'm [ __ ] up,
269,32:34,yeah that was pretty funny hmm yeah oh I forgot to mention what happened today to,
270,32:40,you guys when I went when I went shopping yeah I was on a I was on the hunt for marshmallows and I went,
271,32:47,searching around different shops and I couldn't find them in some places but eventually I did grab some,
272,32:52,um and then on my way maybe this doesn't seem like like a weird thing but to me,
273,32:58,it was probably the most dangerous thing I'd seen in my entire life so there are these kids riding bikes okay I want you,
274,33:05,to imagine this a bike for a small child um let's say maybe about eight years old,
275,33:10,no not a tricycle uh uh maybe kids first two-wheel bicycle no training wheels,
276,33:16,okay for maybe an eight-year-old child and I want you to imagine a tiny little,
277,33:22,eight-year-old Japanese boy uh writing on said bicycle but,
278,33:28,it's not just him he's not the only one on this little bicycle no no no no there's another,
279,33:33,child that's right there's a there's maybe a six-year-old little boy who I,
280,33:39,assume is his brother and the way that he is sitting on this bicycle is that his brother is in sort of a bear hug,
281,33:46,position around him grasping both the handlebars and pedaling of course but his knees are very far spread apart and,
282,33:52,the little boy the six-year-old is balancing by his two feet and grabbing,
283,33:57,onto the middle bar of the bicycle and they are they are cruising down the,
284,34:03,sidewalk and I was like that is the most dangerous thing I've seen in my entire,
285,34:09,life boys can you please stop I don't know what happened to him I hope they're safe,
286,34:15,in Japan in Japan yeah in Japan I was like is this an anime,
287,34:21,am I watching an anime right now where are the parents I don't know there was a whole gang of other kids on bicycles,
288,34:27,behind him though so maybe they were like a little like mini like like bicycle crew,
289,34:34,yeah we always ride on our bikes like this oh my God this is the anime moment,
290,34:40,where like the policeman comes out of the booth and he's like no time tandem writing is that what they call it,
291,34:47,is that what it is I don't know what it is that what it is is that what it's called what's on your handlebars I,
292,34:54,vaguely remember seeing that as a subtitle in some anime that I watched yeah I mean it would have been much,
293,34:59,cuter if like the the little one was on the handlebars or maybe like on the back of the seat but no that was just the,
294,35:05,most horrifying thing I'd seen that day I mean I was thinking are those kids,
295,35:11,gonna make it are they okay man a little tattoo and Connor,
296,35:19,yeah very cute and then another weird thing happened I you know got my goods I got,
297,35:26,into the house and I just I got the goods and I just sprawled out on the,
298,35:32,couch and I just like started eating a Popsicle played a little played some video games and I was like I don't know,
299,35:37,why but being outside for two seconds has made me extremely tired let me go take a nap so I went to go take a nap,
300,35:42,and I get interrupted like mid nap as I'm straight falling into like the really good part of sleep so I'm super,
301,35:49,crabby right well I get up and I go to the door and I see a very official human being at my door and I'm like oh no I'm,
302,35:57,super scared so I let him at night uh I mean it was like yeah it was a couple a,
303,36:02,couple hours ago but I see a a an individual with a clipboard and [ __ ] so,
304,36:07,I'm like oh man they're coming to get me and I I hadn't paid my I hadn't paid my bills in a little bit I took care of it,
305,36:13,all today but like I hadn't done it in a while and so I was like oh man they're gonna get me for not paying my bills and,
306,36:19,stuff like that I better go answer the door so I answer the door and you guys know my Japanese is fine like I can get,
307,36:26,by and like like it's it's it's decent and I can have regular conversations with people,
308,36:32,however um this guy comes up to my door and uh,
309,36:38,starts explaining something about one of my like utilities and I thought to myself dang it I didn't pay the bill oh,
310,36:44,man and the way that it was explained to me in Japanese um made it sound like it was something that I had to get like something that I,
311,36:52,absolutely had to get and they're like why haven't you been answering our phone calls Etc and I did see that somebody had called me a couple times I was like,
312,36:58,God damn this is bad oh wait I think I know what you're talking about now yeah I don't want to give too many details,
313,37:04,about it but yeah you probably know what I'm talking about right so I'm like okay let me fill out all your stuff and dudes,
314,37:11,like it'll take just a moment and I'm like okay thank goodness I sit out there outside in the Blazing heat for 45,
315,37:16,minutes with this gentleman oh my gosh filling out things opening up QR codes writing down details Etc and the dude,
316,37:24,starts becoming increasingly nice to me like oh well your Japanese is so good it,
317,37:29,wow it sure is amazing is he a Salesman and then he he was like oh yes you have,
318,37:36,all the documents because he kept asking me for like official documents that I had and I was like this must be a real thing that I have to do and so I pulled,
319,37:43,out all the documents that I had saved and I was like here you go he's like oh wonderful you kept it very good and I,
320,37:48,was like um all right well what I mean this is a little suspicious but okay so I did it right I filled out all the [ __ ],
321,37:54,and then I messaged along the way I messaged um my cool neighbor lady the,
322,38:00,cicada throwing neighbor lady uh let's call her Midori job because she has green hair she has like dark green hair,
323,38:05,so we'll call her Midori sham I call Midori Chan or I texted her and I was like Hey Midori Chan,
324,38:11,um I'm a little worried because there's a guy out here and I think that this is something I have to do and I kind of,
325,38:17,understood what he said but I asked him a couple times is this something I need and he kept avoiding the question,
326,38:23,um and giving long complicated explanations so Midori Chan says here I'm coming over let me give him a call,
327,38:30,because dude dude gave me this number right so Midori Chan comes over and,
328,38:35,places a call and uh she sounds very cross,
329,38:41,and uh she hangs up and she's like,
330,38:46,this happens a lot like this is this is this is something that happens very,
331,38:52,often um nah they just basically convinced you to switch providers and I was like bro,
332,38:58,are you serious she's like don't worry I canceled it for you and I was like thanks Midori Chan,
333,39:05,she's such a Chad she always helps me she's like it's okay this happens very often and I don't think it was very nice,
334,39:12,of them to take advantage of the fact that you're Japanese it's like it's not perfect so you can't really understand the details they were firing off some,
335,39:19,really musakashi nihongo,
336,39:26,yeah yeah they don't they don't act that nice and and use Simple Japanese no they,
337,39:32,go hard like yeah that just reminds me of like that's why like whenever I see like salesperson people at the door I,
338,39:41,just don't answer it's smart I just don't answer um and if it's something really like like for example like oh I needed to pay,
339,39:47,for something or feel something like mandatory then they would usually leave something behind you know true you have,
340,39:54,a note or something and then I can just call them back or or do something about it but if not I just the moment I see,
341,40:01,someone with like a like you said like a clip yeah yeah with like a pet and stuff like that I'm,
342,40:08,just like nope I'm not answering that I should have known because in the past I've said that to salesmen and been like,
343,40:14,do I need to do this and then they'll like give an explanation that's long and I'll be like goodbye and like pretend,
344,40:19,that I don't speak Japanese but I guess he saw that I spoke enough that he was like all right I can I can do this but,
345,40:25,yeah it didn't turn out very well for me and I guess not for them either um,
346,40:31,single stay away from me Dottie Chan I need her to throw cicadas for me,
347,40:37,but it all turned out okay it turned out okay in the end and uh yeah I learned a lesson again so,
348,40:43,sales people is scary story like oh this was like ages the most intense,
349,40:51,um experience that Mama rat and I had to go to like make sure that like that we,
350,40:56,made the salesperson think that we weren't home because we also avoid you know answering the door if it's like a salesperson and normally like if they're,
351,41:03,normal they will like you know ring the doorbell knock maybe a couple times and then if no one answers they'll walk away but no we a couple years ago we had,
352,41:11,someone bang on the door like constantly and then like yell like because they saw,
353,41:17,there was a car in the driveway they started yelling things like we know you're you're home oh my God it's scary,
354,41:22,scary but they were they look like a salesperson because they had that like clipboard right so Mama red and I was,
355,41:29,quite young at the time and then she immediately was like Hey get on the floor and I was like what because we have like this window you can kind of,
356,41:37,see so like if you imagine the dull way and then there's like a giant window you can,
357,41:43,kind of see into the window if you like you know kind of like position yourself,
358,41:48,um at the doorway so she immediately said get on the floor and I was like what because the guy wasn't moving he,
359,41:55,was just standing there and he wasn't like leaving he was just standing there and then I got on the floor and then she,
360,42:00,started crawling towards me and I'm like [ __ ] it's like Movie experience oh my God,
361,42:12,whatever you do don't get up and I was like but I need to go to the kitchen to get water,
362,42:23,that reminds me of like like an hour the guy left but I was like hello,
363,42:29,you're desperate are you oh my god wow an hour that's long yeah it reminds me,
364,42:37,of like how you know how I said that I don't answer like I just I just don't answer if I feel like the person's,
365,42:42,suspicious or not it's really hard to do that though like you said when they kind of know that you're home because like,
366,42:48,like right before they run the oh I got kicked out wait no oh I get you back I,
367,42:55,get you back let me let me back in there I get you back in here uh oh I left too,
368,43:01,oh oh we all got kicked they didn't like iris's story it's fine I'm making a new,
369,43:07,one I didn't even start it didn't even start the premonition,
370,43:13,I don't think so no it's cool I'll get you guys back it's the same as before all the same stuff,
371,43:19,yeah there you are okay I'll just I'll just keep talking about it while I'm while I'm I'm invisible but um anyways,
372,43:26,yeah what was I talking about oh yeah so like I was I just happened to be like was binge watching some sort of anime or,
373,43:32,something so I was like I was listening to it on speakers too and you know how the walls are thin yeah so thin over,
374,43:39,back here in Virtual Japan so I'm pretty sure they could hear me watching like like,
375,43:49,through the door that's how they would ring the doorbell like at least five to ten times thinking I'd be but I'm just,
376,43:55,like nope I'm not gonna answer nope nope nope nope I just mute the anime right away and I turn off the lights and of,
377,44:01,course they know that I'm home but I just pretend like nope nope yeah here we go okay I'm gonna move,
378,44:08,oh yeah okay is Iris in here I'm coming,
379,44:13,hurry up I'm kidding I'm kidding there we go I'm here there she is there's hope hope is descended now I'm gonna arrange,
380,44:19,everyone again sorry for the slight weight you guys it's fine you can just listen to us and and believe it on your,
381,44:26,heart it's okay no no you guys you guys were saying that I wasn't on the screen,
382,44:31,but no actually I was camouflaging with him,
383,44:39,with the blanket right there he just went outside to you know,

385,44:53,guys let us gather give us a second to gather the firewood okay okay we're,
386,44:58,gonna get some sticks yeah and like stick some rocks and another thing that I just I just,
387,45:04,remembered you know how you guys are talking about how sales people and a lot of times people who come to your door,
388,45:10,are also scammers yeah yeah cameras yeah and there's this one like my mom told me,
389,45:15,the story of that this this very um distinct scam sort of sort of scam uh,
390,45:22,thing that happens sometimes very rarely though but sometimes in Japan is when a very cute girl comes to your door with,
391,45:29,fruit like she would come with like a wagon of fruit and she'd be like could,
392,45:34,you please buy fruit why does the sun Snow White sound I don't know I think,
393,45:41,she would come with like she would come with like melons or or like a lot of fresh fruit be like these are just fresh they came fresh from the like they would,
394,45:48,buy it from some sort of supermarket close by and then they would sell it for like three times the price being like can you please buy the fruit I'm I'm in,
395,45:56,I need I need the money um please buy the fruit and it would be a pretty cute girl,
396,46:02,yeah and some people would be like oh you know sure it's hot outside and they don't want to a lot of times they would,
397,46:09,come like in the middle of like a rainstorm because they don't they want to make you feel bad basically like they,
398,46:14,they would come with like an umbrella like with a whole raincoat being like drenched and they're for fruit also,
399,46:20,being drenched in rain and they're pretty much really good please I I've been like going through so many,
400,46:26,different houses please please buy and they were you're like oh is she okay she's like in the middle of a storm and,
401,46:33,it's it's pretty it's pretty that's a big yeah yeah it is really a buy,
402,46:38,business when you think about it I'm sure there's a car nearby or something but they they would make a girl like,
403,46:44,look like she's alone outside with like with nothing just an umbrella and like,
404,46:49,being drenched in the rain yep does this happen in the cities suburbs are like where does this usually I don't know,
405,46:55,I've heard this happens like I mean you know in in pretty much this,
406,47:02,I've heard stories about this one like cities too not not only like suburbs yeah,
407,47:07,people are ruthless playing off the pity of human beings I mean yeah I mean we've,
408,47:14,been talking a lot about like bad experiences have you ever had like a really like good dolanaka experience,
409,47:20,um experience no not really I have oh yeah I've had just one it was very,
410,47:28,wholesome and I went to bed really happy that night um basically this was around the time,
411,47:34,where um you know the world kind of uh shut down and like right at the beginning of,
412,47:40,it and a lot of people were experiencing um like financial troubles obviously because you know people were losing,
413,47:45,their jobs Etc and stuff so one day I was home I think I was it was a weekend or something and I was,
414,47:52,just chilling with my morning coffee as I normally do and then someone knocks on the door I did not get on the ground because I,
415,47:59,saw it was just it was a lady um carrying like a big basket and I was like oh what was this and I opened the,
416,48:05,door and she was she looked it was a really nice lady and she had like a basket full of muffins that she had it,
417,48:11,was like I could feel the heat it was like freshly baked she was like hi would you be interested,
418,48:17,in purchasing some muffins um they're handmade um we've just been experiencing you know,
419,48:24,some some difficulties and we really appreciate if you could you know spare some um money and some support and I was,
420,48:32,like oh my God I'll take it all I didn't take it all but I bought like um I,
421,48:38,bought like three blueberry muffins and three chocolate muffins and big size muffins as well and then and she was,
422,48:44,like thank you so much and we really really appreciate it and then she left and then I had a blueberry muffin with,
423,48:49,my morning coffee and it was wow ah that sounds nice though because like if they actually cooked that's a different thing,
424,48:55,you know yeah no it was like yeah you can you know how you can tell if it's like a homemade muffin versus like,
425,49:01,wrapped in plastic bought from the store no even the shape of the muffin like you,
426,49:07,know how store-bought muffins are really perfect looking yeah they're too perfect they all look perfect identical yeah and,
427,49:13,then you can also tell because like in the blueberry muffin there was like real big blueberries inside and I was like oh,
428,49:20,my God like it's not just blueberry jam oh that's so happy blueberry muffin now from a suite,
429,49:27,did any of you guys do um did any of you guys do Girl Scout [ __ ] back in the day oh I didn't do Girl Scout but my school,
430,49:34,had this fundraiser thing where they had us so candy yeah candy bars a whole box,
431,49:42,it's like a whole box worth of like a hundred dollars worth of candy bars they could go sell them and it's just like oh,
432,49:47,my God that was that was one of them I hated that I hated that having to go,
433,49:52,door to door be like please buy candy and they would have to pity by so yeah I mean the Girl Scout thing does seem like,
434,49:59,a penny buy thing I was actually the only girl that wasn't in Girl Scouts in my small group like in my my small class,
435,50:05,because uh we didn't have enough money and I was the only one out of like,
436,50:11,something like 25 girls um this was when I was very young very young so everyone else was like,
437,50:17,competing for like the cookie sales and stuff like that and at first I was like oh I'm sad I can't be in Girl Scouts but,
438,50:23,then I heard them talk about all the cookie sales and how hard it was to spend their weekends going like across the neighborhoods like trying to sell,
439,50:30,cookies and I thought I don't give a [ __ ] anymore [ __ ] Girl Scouts sir I was dying when,
440,50:35,Iris said the selling chocolates thing because my entire rat School Korea I,
441,50:41,think we did that chocolate thing maybe like four five years and every single,
442,50:47,year I would sell the entire books but I personally only sold one bar,
443,50:52,I will always give the books,
444,51:00,that is cheating that is cheating I've only sold one chocolate blindness to my,
445,51:06,neighbor and it took me half an hour oh my God yeah literally me like the,
446,51:13,first few doors are just it's just your heart is thumping so loud and you're just like oh my God they're gonna be,
447,51:19,scary but yeah like I basically went I was like living in a condominium back,
448,51:25,then so I just went through every single floor um knocking on doors and I think I was,
449,51:30,able to sell pretty much the whole box uh I think I bought a few myself too to,
450,51:36,make up for some but yeah like uh I only had to do that once so thankfully,
451,51:41,thankfully yeah it was a horrible experience and you feel you feel horrible when they say no yeah I don't,
452,51:47,know what that is the steel you need to have nerves to steal being a Salesman you reminded me of another sweet memory,
453,51:53,though that I had back when I was visiting uh Papa Reaper I hung out with some of the kids in the cold the,
454,51:59,cul-de-sac and um we were just playing like we just play like make-believe games and stuff like that and then we,
455,52:04,got this harebrained scheme idea to go pick up pine cones and pine branches and,
456,52:10,sell them to the people that lived in the cul-de-sac so we would go knock on,
457,52:15,people's doors [ __ ] we found on the ground man just,
458,52:21,outside their houses and everyone said no except for like one,
459,52:29,one guy like a teenage kid gave us like 25 cents,
460,52:34,my favorite was the 45 year old dude with like a beer belly and like kids in the house who came out and was like what,
461,52:41,are you kids doing and we're like would you like to buy a pine cone sir and he said he said nah I'm good,
462,52:48,um you all need to put that stuff back in the yard and then close the door,
463,52:55,we did our best though,
464,53:01,but that kid that gave us a quarter definitely took the branch in his house and put it right in the trash can,
465,53:07,yeah at least he gave me something out of it that's nice yeah that was a sweet guy oh,
466,53:14,man how to be young and stupid but full of hopes and dreams,
467,53:19,that just reminds me of how like um you know trick-or-treating yeah oh my,
468,53:25,God maybe you should talk about this during all like October but like um you know like how um sometimes you,
469,53:31,would go trick-or-treating in the neighborhood and sometimes they don't still can't they don't have candy so you know what they would give us instead money,
470,53:41,here you go they give us like 50 cents or like a dollar instead and be like okay that's fine too,
471,53:49,I've never gone trick-or-treating to begin with but what that's crazy I love it I don't know,
472,53:55,sometimes sometimes they would like oh we don't have candy so we'll just give you some some coins,
473,54:01,a little change jar crazy what yeah that's some change yeah I got some change here you go sort of kind of smart,
474,54:07,to be honest you probably spend less money just giving them coins than going out buying a ton of candy bars to give,
475,54:13,to kids that's pretty that's true I think yeah [Music] oh Halloween I'm excited I'm gonna we,

547,1:02:10,it's I think the story has gotten convoluted and not great but it's such a classic part of my childhood that I'm,
548,1:02:15,like oh man these two never play Kingdom Hearts ooh,
549,1:02:21,thank you I didn't have a PlayStation so I didn't have a childhood I'm sorry oh,
550,1:02:27,yeah that makes a lot of sense actually no YouTube that actually does make a lot of sense I cried really hard when I,
551,1:02:32,couldn't get Kingdom Hearts the year that it came out because I asked for Kingdom Hearts for for Christmas right and um and I did not get it because it,
552,1:02:40,requires a PlayStation 2 which I did not ask for which,
553,1:02:46,um Mama worry slash parental units were like what is this expensive thing no you can get one during a celebration some,
554,1:02:52,year and then the other another year and I was like okay but then a friend ended up letting me borrow Kingdom Hearts and,
555,1:02:58,then I kind of never gave it back because our family lost contact with them so it's it's fine I'm sure it was,
556,1:03:05,okay they didn't really play it a lot oh my God it's fun it's fun,
557,1:03:12,no I didn't my Thief not a thief and I was young,
558,1:03:19,I only have a place I only had a PlayStation the very first PlayStation for some reason and that's the game that,
559,1:03:27,mean the only game we played on that PlayStation was proper the rapper oh based okay never mind yeah cool,
560,1:03:33,or after the rapper was really cool you know Parappa you gotta believe yeah you gotta believe,
561,1:03:40,and turn to the right oh it's so fun I got a crack crack crack the egg into the,
562,1:03:47,bowl it's so fun I love that game it's so cute it's like,
563,1:03:52,I was horrible at it though I kept failing and the moment you fail yeah when the moment you feel the the wrap,
564,1:03:58,also starts failing too and like everything just collapses around you yeah this is just the rest I love it,
565,1:04:05,that's how I got into rap yeah yeah Parappa that's a I mean it's a good segue I would say it's all English too,
566,1:04:12,right um even though it's like a Japan game it's all in English right for sure is that so you can imagine I'm pretty,
567,1:04:18,sure I don't think there's a Japanese version I gotta believe has always been English even the original cool yeah,
568,1:04:25,needs that is very cool I want to play it again sometime soon man has anyone played gitaru man,
569,1:04:33,is that Guitar Man guitar room Guitar Hero no it's a guitar man what gets a,
570,1:04:40,room man no I've never heard of this I love,
571,1:04:47,guitar man it did not get nearly enough the what it deserved yes yes there's a,
572,1:04:54,PS2 I think it's for PS2 I love gitaru man yeah look at these people and yeah in the chat they know guitaruman,
573,1:05:02,it's a really fun game but it was kind of hard for me personally I played it at a friend's house because um they were,
574,1:05:08,really into it it looks cute yeah it's a cute game I love like those wings on this helmet,
575,1:05:13,yeah when I think of PaRappa the Rapper I think of guitar room and somehow because like they they give me similar,
576,1:05:18,vibes they do yeah for whatever reason I don't know what it is it's just games like that I guess the art style kind of,
577,1:05:25,just like reminds me of each other or like the fact that they're kind of like music e-based old older games,
578,1:05:31,yeah wow older games I'm trying to think of what older games did I play,
579,1:05:39,um ah there was this Pokemon game that I think,
580,1:05:45,um me and my sister used to be able to play when we had a Nintendo 64 that,
581,1:05:51,disappeared one day I don't remember how that happened but Nintendo 64 and there,
582,1:05:56,was Pokemon Stadium Pokemon Stadium was a great game that's an awesome game I,
583,1:06:04,remember there was I remember there was a sushi mini game um with like the bed what do you call,
584,1:06:10,the the the Lickitung Lickitung lickitungs would basically fight each,
585,1:06:16,other for like the sushi and the sushi go around that was like the game that me and my fam like our whole family loved,
586,1:06:22,playing for some reason like fighting over the sushi that was like the only mini game we played mainly on on Pokemon,
587,1:06:28,Stadium and we've always wanted to play that but I think our our Nintendo 64 broke or something oh so yeah oh my God,
588,1:06:37,I I wish we could have a Nintendo 64 again those are great right and then we got GameCube after that yeah yeah,
589,1:06:43,Nintendo 64 was pretty goaded there's so many good games on the Nintendo 64 that,
590,1:06:49,like we can't stream or anything because it's the freaking Nintendo 64. I mean we can't stream properly,
591,1:06:56,um but some of them are getting ported actually to like people to the switch or yes either switch or like PC for example,
592,1:07:02,there was this game called Glover where you play as like a glove and like you roll around on a wall yeah it's insane,
593,1:07:09,and it dominated my childhood yeah because it was so mysterious to me and uh they recently ported it to PC and I I,
594,1:07:17,realized it because they put it in the permissions list and I was like what is Glover doing here,
595,1:07:23,this reminds me of the you know the the um what do you call it you know Super,
596,1:07:28,Smash Bros the um you know the the white hand Floridian,
597,1:07:33,thing yeah Master Hand around it just reminds me of Master Hand,
598,1:07:41,yeah and then here's Bays Bays Bays just to two young times,
599,1:07:54,such a little baby child cute man do you at least know what GameCube,

606,1:08:41,top of the charger first,
607,1:08:47,literally I had like a whole couch on top of them,
608,1:08:53,and then one day just stopped charging and that's when I when my SP died yeah no [ __ ],
609,1:09:02,yeah I can't say I'm saying I'm surprised about that what was your favorite game games for the the SP babe,
610,1:09:09,or for the Game Boy I only had two it was Pokemon Ruby and eventually and then,

635,1:11:58,were different versions kind of like Pokemon how they had blue and red yeah they had the different colors it's a,
636,1:12:03,smart business tactic if you really think about it that is true for collectors,

741,1:23:36,name things under that category without repeating so names things in that category oh okay,
742,1:23:43,it's supposed to initially keep a rhythm um but because obviously lag we can't do that usually you'd go like,

872,1:38:17,right after the anime and it's literally like another whole full-on it's just,
873,1:38:22,blood C again season two yeah pretty much,
874,1:38:28,how about that I feel like I missed so many good anime though damn it,
875,1:38:35,so many there is a lot of good anime out there Cali yeah Iris took a lot of the ones I,
876,1:38:41,was gonna say like maiden abyss and um and tank and tapagger and lagon but then I came in swiftly with the ovas,
877,1:38:48,save myself there for a minute I mean I think like I had I have a um,
878,1:38:56,I like I don't know there was this list of anime that um I guess how do I wait,
879,1:39:02,hold on let me collect my thoughts I used to write down every single anime that I'd watched so,
880,1:39:09,um I'm very fresh with that list so uh it's okay guys it's okay and one,
881,1:39:17,thing that I've recently started one one um series I started reading that doesn't have an anime but it's coming it was so,
882,1:39:24,good was chainsaw man [Music],
883,1:39:34,doesn't come out yet I think it's getting you for like it's getting an anime yeah but I read all of I've read,
884,1:39:40,all of part one of Chainsaw man I think they just started part two right now um that's really good oh it's really,
885,1:39:47,good yeah like people people say like you know oh um uh what do you call it you know Demon,
886,1:39:54,Slayer or uh what you may call it the other one um,
887,1:40:00,the other one that's really popular um and um Attack on Titan attack no no,
888,1:40:07,not attack on Titan I mean Demon Slayer and the other one um,
889,1:40:15,everyone's like damn answer and I'm just like really is it that good,
890,1:40:20,like I mean you know I kind of got tired of Judith Carson halfway through but um um I heard that the main character of,
891,1:40:27,Chainsaw man is insufferable and really unlikable but I really I kind of liked,
892,1:40:32,him he was very like I mean he's not your typical Shonen protagonist because yeah but but I think he's likable like I,
893,1:40:39,I really liked it I really really like chainsaw man anime oh maybe I'll check it out like I feel like people say,
894,1:40:46,Judith kaisen but I feel like a chainsaw man is just way up there compared to like I I can't wait for the anime,
895,1:40:52,seriously it's so good I think like you can watch you can read um volume one and volume two both on,
896,1:40:58,book Life for free right now not sponsored by the way,
897,1:41:04,interesting yeah maybe I'll read it then maybe I'll read it from a couple people I know that really like Comics they were,
898,1:41:09,like yeah main characters super mid unlikable Etc but it seems like chat seems to like dude a lot so yeah maybe,
899,1:41:15,I'll give it his name but I love chainsaw man it was great I read through all 11 volunteers like whoosh in like a,
900,1:41:22,couple hours literally that's another one oh Samurai shampoo I love it oh that,
901,1:41:27,one's so good I haven't actually watched Samurai Champloo it was kind of confusing because I was very young when,
902,1:41:33,I watched this I didn't understand things that happened but it was very good nonetheless mm-hmm,
903,1:41:40,wait Did anyone say Baki monogatari no wow I feel like an idiot,
904,1:41:46,no so many I [ __ ] love Yeah God that anime is so goated,
905,1:41:56,Haiku basketball,
906,1:42:01,just feels so blish that I I what what,
907,1:42:07,I'm sorry could have gone back thank you I still forgive but critical no basket is BL,
908,1:42:15,it's BL you haven't gotten past the first season,
909,1:42:21,is definitely BL no no no no it actually isn't there,
910,1:42:27,um like that if you want that no it isn't I know it's not it's not I think,
911,1:42:32,um maybe because I'm an avid basketball fan it's not it is not it is not um BL it is amazing basketball where one match,
912,1:42:40,lasts for four episodes and it's amazing and then one you get it's like the character development and then in like,
913,1:42:46,in the first season it's like good I could never speak without like getting casual form and then he got really bad,
914,1:42:53,in season three and then he he dropped the death and then you're like oh wait does kudoku even wait are there,
915,1:43:00,even any girls in the critical basket anime the manager of course yeah of course there's only of,
916,1:43:07,course the manager but I mean but it's like he's totally with the red-haired,
917,1:43:12,dude the the dude you guys like slam bones,
918,1:43:20,nothing going on I watched like I watched at least half of half of Buddha basket like season one well that's fine,
919,1:43:26,it's season two and season three you gotta watch it's so good only then do,
920,1:43:31,you truly understand that all they care about is basketball yeah because they're Chads they have,
921,1:43:39,passion for the ball,
922,1:43:47,iq's Bill excuse me I don't know hike you feel still still feels like but I,
923,1:43:52,don't know I I watched like one whole season of haikyu didn't really feel for me for some reason it didn't I it felt,
924,1:43:59,more like Bromance but kunoko felt BL to me no no no no no no no no unbased,
925,1:44:05,uncultured okay what about what about the we could I mean have a hike you then do you think that's built no no right,
926,1:44:12,right yeah but using your logic how is high do you not BL and kudoku it doesn't,
927,1:44:17,make sense just because you're going on with the two main characters,
928,1:44:23,I feel it really I don't know there's so much like and the fact that they made,
929,1:44:29,Kuroko like this the short like kind of girly looking one,
930,1:44:34,really I don't know,
931,1:44:41,um any other sports anime that that feels like that,
932,1:44:47,um I mean what is your real nice yeah of course Yuri on ice but you're real nice I remember that one there was a lot of,
933,1:44:53,Commodities it's Yuri on Ice it's a different it's a different plane,
934,1:44:59,I actually kind of enjoyed it on ice halfway,
935,1:45:05,um and then except and then I I I just didn't like the pairing I guess,
936,1:45:12,like they were cool but but at like halfway,
937,1:45:17,through I just didn't really care about Yuri and then I only cared about the other Yuri like the other Yuri the young,
938,1:45:23,Erie right the the other the young Yuri young Yuri was great I didn't give a she,
939,1:45:28,talk about the main Yuri I'm gonna cry that's kind of rare,
940,1:45:37,see here's the thing I really enjoy Sports Anime because of like the competition um and stuff like that because I can,
941,1:45:43,relate because there was one time when I when um I was playing basketball and then it was like common then we lost,
942,1:45:49,like two points and I started bawling after the match so I do get like that feeling of competition which is I think,
943,1:45:55,why I like watching sports anime I don't know why Yuri on ice made me cry of all things but like towards the end I think,
944,1:46:01,it did it made me a little bit teary yeah I remember when that came out on,
945,1:46:06,the internet it was a big thing the only Sports Anime I ever watch is do you guys,
946,1:46:12,know one outs the baseball one no I don't know nobody wins but I I,
947,1:46:19,freaking love one ounce I watch I throw it on I throw it on the TV when I'm like doing things in the,

1002,1:52:10,from very early on I was like huh I definitely have taste in anime because like I would look,
1003,1:52:16,at what I would watch and then I'd go into like the romance um list and it's just,
1004,1:52:22,it's like 10 times longer than any other genre list that I had enough oh you like,

1021,1:54:20,it,
1022,1:54:25,I've watched it I've watched umaru Chan um yeah oh speaking of like mouths speaking,
1023,1:54:34,of mouse anime one one thing that I personally recommend if you like sci-fi that I've recently uh watched sort of,
1024,1:54:42,recommend it's it's actually really really good at least um it has a lot of gambling in it too of halfway through,
1025,1:54:47,for some reason but um it's called no no it's not kakikuri no it's called mardok scramble I've,
1026,1:54:54,never heard of that before it's actually a series of three different animated movies it's it's very it's very under,
1027,1:55:00,the radar but it was it was really good it has a golden mouse that's it's pretty,
1028,1:55:06,cool looking cute yeah smartok scramble is really good I liked it damn that was pretty sick yeah it's a three movie,
1029,1:55:13,series so it just ends pretty quickly too but I really like it it's a lot of,
1030,1:55:18,action and yeah it's badass girl speaking about like anime that we used to watch I just remember like the golden,
1031,1:55:26,the Golden romance animes that like you know anyone asked me for like um,
1032,1:55:31,recommendations I just always said the same ones over and over again like you had made summer Toradora special,
1033,1:55:38,ah especially is my childhood I remember I,
1034,1:55:44,I was I was fangirling over k for a long period of time for some reason,
1035,1:55:49,it's not funny because like literally you re-wash it and it's just so ridiculous the things,
1036,1:55:57,it just doesn't make sense but it was just it was so good it makes no sense at all but no sense at all yeah I I I,
1037,1:56:05,watched that man and I read all I have all the volumes on digitally um on the manga yeah I have all I love my name,
1038,1:56:11,again manga a lot but yeah oh my God it's just another one it was like what's,
1039,1:56:16,the other one hold on hold on hold on,
1040,1:56:33,yeah it's actually like um it's actually it follows the manga right I'm pretty,
1041,1:56:39,sure the original Fruits Basket had a totally different um anime open-ending thing going on,
1042,1:56:45,manga wasn't over then yeah yeah the first basket is just I,
1043,1:56:50,mean I I really like yo so of course but um I don't know,
1044,1:56:56,[Music] oh you know Yuki you know how like you like the other dude that she oh,
1045,1:57:03,um spoiler alert that she doesn't end up with um and but in the end he's like Yuki is,
1046,1:57:10,just like it's okay because toru was kind of like my mom and I'm just like really you're gonna mob categorize,
1047,1:57:17,when the whole comic has been and I feel like I feel like that was,
1048,1:57:24,just him coping yeah why did he have to say mom like you were,
1049,1:57:30,my mom yeah and then those coming summer kiss,
1050,1:57:37,yes did any of you guys watch Tokyo Mew Mew,
1051,1:57:46,oh I know they're making a remake first anime and it's one it's one of my favorite anime ever because I used to,
1052,1:57:53,make I had like an original character for Tokyo Mew Mew and it was the first anime I ever watched and of course it,
1053,1:57:59,was a magical girl anime long time ago for some reason for some reason I mixed,
1054,1:58:04,up Tokyo Mew Mew with did you carrot back then you guys don't don't know digikatta,
1055,1:58:14,it's another cat eared anime that's why I mixed them too up makes sense okay,
1056,1:58:20,your girls yeah he's a special cat though Ichigo she's a special cat she's an endangered species cat because all of,
1057,1:58:27,the the girls are based off of uh endangered species animals,
1058,1:58:40,Tara is that how you pronounce it yeah yeah yeah,
1059,1:58:47,I remember that stop oh my God,
1060,1:58:55,yes oh my oh my oh my goodness oh my,
1061,1:59:01,goodness so many uh I really liked kyoyo from Oren High,
1062,1:59:07,School Host Club I remember I think he was my introduction into Mega names yeah favorite of The Host Club so Cali I,
1063,1:59:17,like the twins I like the Twins and I like the I like the the bunny boy too bunny boys,
1064,1:59:24,God I hated that kid I wanted to strangle in the whole anime I like morikun oh thanks babe appreciate,
1065,1:59:33,that and I was I had a I had a very clear type for uh Shoujo,
1066,1:59:42,um JoJo crushes back in the day it was the guys that were Broody and never talked and didn't say anything but they,
1067,1:59:49,were cool that sounds about right he came in silent type very tall or in school club,
1068,1:59:57,now that I look at the pictures their legs are all so long right it makes no sense,
1069,2:00:05,besides that what is it's like that clamp style where like the the legs are,
1070,2:00:10,just they're very long very very long very like they could stab you with their legs and like turn you into like a,
1071,2:00:16,skewer kind of thing what do you guys like from clamp that is not CC Sakura,
1072,2:00:23,oh let's see what did they write again I forgot um clam clamp what the manga slime the,
1073,2:00:32,manga Circle that made a lot of stuff I wanted I want to test your guys's,
1074,2:00:37,taste and clamp wait let me see I don't even know what there's a lot of stuff there's cha bits there's I'm gonna make,
1075,2:00:44,sure that shows they oh gosh okay let's see yes they did,
1076,2:00:50,Sakura you can't go wrong with foreign,
1077,2:00:57,[Laughter],
1078,2:01:11,[Music],
1079,2:01:29,my number one recommendation when it comes to clap anime not manga not manga,
1080,2:01:34,let's forget about the manga the anime is um the the doll fighting one way,
1081,2:01:40,um um uh uh Angelic lair,
1082,2:01:47,I'm looking forward I found it it's right stuff oh this looks kind of you,
1083,2:01:54,know what Angelic Angelic layer Angelic glare it really reminds me of furniture,
1084,2:01:59,the super rope Super Robot Roboto Super Robot and you know the the,
1085,2:02:07,game that Colton isn't but I was playing the other day that I really want to play but there's no English version so I'm just so bummed,
1086,2:02:13,um oh kind of reminds me of that for some reason this looks cute I like yeah I,
1087,2:02:21,think there's great it's great stuff I highly recommend it's like Shonen Shojo sort of thing,
1088,2:02:28,with fight a lot of like fighting with your little doll thing um and also there's romance and it's,
1089,2:02:35,it's good it's good I liked it I don't like the manga because the ships,
1090,2:02:41,in the manga and the anime are different so um,
1091,2:02:48,watch the anime yeah this looks cool,
1092,2:02:55,oh wait I can't believe we're forgetting something so important to to me do you,
1093,2:03:01,guys do you guys know anything about devil man cry yeah,
1094,2:03:17,oh my God I want to cry oh,
1095,2:03:26,it's fine but the original Mongoose um,
1096,2:03:35,I heard a lot of people saying that people who like the original didn't were not satisfied with cry baby is what I,
1097,2:03:42,heard yeah and like I said it's so much better it's fine original where people actually like I like the OVA better or,
1098,2:03:50,like you know ring mag not really not really I feel like the remakes are always just they're never gonna pass the,
1099,2:03:56,original usually I wish that they had made the original but like not devil man like they had made it like a different,
1100,2:04:02,character like maybe inspired by devil man but like it just it wasn't like,
1101,2:04:07,original devil man you know like the original mang is just so goaded I don't know if you would like it though Bay I,
1102,2:04:14,don't really know if it's your style but you might like you might like the crybaby anime just don't read the Manga beforehand I would recommend is it that,
1103,2:04:21,different yeah story no it's I mean this no the story is there are there are some differences,
1104,2:04:27,um it follows like the main plot line but the art style is wildly different like oh yeah wildly different and there,
1105,2:04:34,are some differences in like what happens to characters throughout the story and yeah it's just uh nah crybaby,
1106,2:04:40,is very beautiful I like the rap characters or like I've heard of it sorry continue,
1107,2:04:47,please continue I'm sorry sorry no problem no problem cry baby it's like it's really I heard good things about it,
1108,2:04:54,and it looks cool but it's I heard it's just really dark um I think I kind of spilled myself half,
1109,2:05:01,half what happened um sorry sorry yeah good that's dark sad,
1110,2:05:07,and I feel like it's a little a little kind of BL ish it's extremely,
1111,2:05:13,pessimistic and yes you are correct if you look at it that way maybe possibly yeah it depends it's extremely,
1112,2:05:19,pessimistic I will say but it's so it's so good it's basically saying humans are,
1113,2:05:25,shiitake yeah I mean yeah it's not super wrong but I see as long as you're,
1114,2:05:32,looking on the bright side of life am I right ladies no I'm sorry,
1115,2:05:38,um I was looking at chat and I would like to retract my statement um there is one exception to that,
1116,2:05:44,um sequel versus original um situation Full Metal Alchemist,
1117,2:05:50,Brotherhood yeah true very true yeah Brotherhood is actually really good yeah,
1118,2:06:04,first 10 episodes so like does it really count as like a sequel or something not,
1119,2:06:10,really it's a remake streaming,
1120,2:06:17,and another 100. is that ever gonna restart again,
1121,2:06:23,uh the manga the manga just doesn't doesn't really write much so I don't,
1122,2:06:29,know there was like this big thing that happened I saw on Twitter huh oh he's,
1123,2:06:34,like starting it up again oh nice yeah I mean it's always a big thing because he only starts up Hunter Hunter,
1124,2:06:40,once every two or three it's almost like the Olympics or you know oh how to understand they're gonna write four more,
1125,2:06:46,chapters again oh my goodness yeah let's go yep uh it's a rare it's a rare,
1126,2:06:54,occurrence when when mangaka decides to continue Hunter Hunter yep Hiatus X Hiatus it is,
1127,2:07:03,sadness so much sadness sadness there's I think I bet they're still on that boat right,
1128,2:07:10,now I haven't I haven't read the most recent chapters but I bet they're still on that boat Chad can you tell me if,
1129,2:07:15,they're still on that boat they probably are still on that boat we're never gonna leave that boat,
1130,2:07:24,oh my god of course they're still on that boat yep,
1131,2:07:30,so many classy animes bro D grain man I never finished that oh yeah I never,
1132,2:07:36,finished angry man either but I remember liking it at one point Once Upon a Time,
1133,2:07:46,there are a few anime that like I've just binged in one night I've just completely forgotten about like there's,
1134,2:07:52,just been nights back in the day I was like you know I'm down to just not sleep today we can just what binge an entire,
1135,2:07:58,season I have no idea what I watched um and I don't remember it but you did pretty cool yeah but I did,
1136,2:08:04,it's a pretty cool story that happened to me I mean it's not pretty cool it's kind of concerning but the first time I watched Puerto Magicka I don't know if,
1137,2:08:11,I've said this before um I binged Magicka Madoka in one night and I started hallucinating afterwards,
1138,2:08:18,oh my god oh really it's terrific it does do things to you because I didn't,
1139,2:08:23,expect it to be like that I thought it was just a cute magic girl and the whole point of Madoka that's so that's the,
1140,2:08:30,reason why Monica's popular because they thought it was just gonna be cute and then Mommy happens,
1141,2:08:37,I was like at um like a relative's house and then they had like these red lights,
1142,2:08:42,in like the living room and I was like sleeping on the couch like [Laughter],
1143,2:08:49,I think and then I fell asleep on the couch and I was just staring at the red lights and then yeah I may have,
1144,2:08:55,hallucinated I heard that they're finally making a continuation for the the original Puerto,
1145,2:09:02,maduka series I think a movie or something what yeah for the first time in a long time I feel I heard they,
1146,2:09:07,announce that they were making one but I don't know when it's gonna happen I want to see which I'm actually waiting,
1147,2:09:13,for because they kind of left it on a huge Cliffhanger um in the in the movie so yeah if you,
1148,2:09:20,guys ever you guys haven't watched the movie have you no,
1149,2:09:28,I think I have I just I get I don't remember it because I watched it all in,
1150,2:09:33,one night oh yeah okay oh yeah true I remember the opening though I love the movie openings oh yeah go next door,
1151,2:09:41,[Music] oh my God,
1152,2:09:57,um,
1153,2:10:05,maybe looking at the lyrics will remind me of how it goes hold on,
1154,2:10:12,um yeah [Music],
1155,2:10:24,uh,
1156,2:10:36,[Music],
1157,2:10:41,but yeah oh and when I think about Clara's they start thinking about oremo,
1158,2:10:47,and um,
1159,2:10:56,casually gives no opinions on this stream I'm good too I pass no comment no,
1160,2:11:04,comment okay okay we can we cannot tread that okay you guys don't like how about how about you though,
1161,2:11:27,I can't like that that that little sister is such a,
1162,2:11:33,um [Music],
1163,2:11:42,you can't like her it's not it's not even the point about like whether they're they're siblings or not it's,
1164,2:11:47,just I hate you know like she's just I like I like um,
1165,2:11:56,[Music] okay final play games with you little,
1166,2:12:02,[ __ ],
1167,2:12:09,yeah understandable I just find her sogaki Antics to be like slightly,
1168,2:12:14,chuckleworthy though I do wish that she would be kinder to her brother yeah I do kind of want to slap her in the face but,
1169,2:12:19,you know like halfway there I'm just like I'm a man grow up girl but yeah but she kind of grows up at the end a little,
1170,2:12:25,bit she does yeah well she shows she shows growth but I wouldn't say that she completely gets over the way that she is,
1171,2:12:32,like I feel like she just doesn't grow that's why I kind of got tired of it but oh one more towards the end yeah she,
1172,2:12:37,does show like growth as a human being but she still retains the kusogaki energy so I mean it doesn't really feel,
1173,2:12:44,that different but I kind of noticed I don't know she became a little less like insufferable I don't know I think kusugaki are funny,
1174,2:12:51,except when I have to deal with them in real life in which case I wish to strangle but for the most part that's,
1175,2:12:57,why if they're confined to anime it's fine yes I guess,
1176,2:13:03,remember that one yeah Butler oh my god oh sorry I said ooh I didn't mean to,
1177,2:13:11,no no Black Butler I've never watched I've never read it no it's just not my cup of,
1178,2:13:17,tea sorry it's all right I mean I think back when I was baby where I seemed a lot cooler than it actually was I'm just,
1179,2:13:23,gonna say that I don't know Black Butler it looks it looks like via but I'm,
1180,2:13:30,I don't know I don't know live oh I remember that that was a good,
1181,2:13:37,one yeah when it came out I didn't really I didn't watch the movie though I heard,
1182,2:13:43,the movie is really good but maybe it was interesting yeah No Game No Life decides never to,
1183,2:13:51,have a season two for some reason no,
1184,2:14:01,the movie did really well in sales and thing and stuff I think but yeah I don't know why so sad oh,
1185,2:14:11,I watched the drama what is that you don't know anime it's a piano,
1186,2:14:16,romance and it's a it's a manga originally um it's I think it's more like it's not,
1187,2:14:23,really Shojo I think it's a little bit higher age demographic but,
1188,2:14:28,um I really like the drama it was good yo if you like the drama the anime is,
1189,2:14:33,actually pretty good there's three seasons it's like it's it's the more the more times that I watch it it's good,
1190,2:14:39,like the better it gets really I haven't watched it in like a long time so it's a,
1191,2:14:44,good one because I don't remember a lot of it something about it the dude the dude is really I mean I guess he's okay,
1192,2:14:51,not not that bad I mean there's character development which is really nice to see him and that just reminds you you know,
1193,2:15:01,I never watched that oh that's uh in April right yes,
1194,2:15:07,I know what happened I know what happens too and I also really didn't like some of the kid I'm not gonna say anything,
1195,2:15:13,else about that but if there are some characters I didn't enjoy in that show but it is oh yes Future Diary is good,
1196,2:15:21,you know that's a really good binge-worthy one though for like if you have time for a day,
1197,2:15:27,um bacano oh I recommend the dub over the sub,
1198,2:15:32,actually because the dub is actually really good I like kind of curious about bacano it's,
1199,2:15:38,one of those Classics I haven't watched oh God it's so good I seriously recommend it,
1200,2:15:44,but I don't know I don't know [Music],
1201,2:15:55,and then I just got really confused like they have like a three episode season,
1202,2:16:00,2.5 I was so confused and then I just don't know what happened at the end it started really good though yeah stop,
1203,2:16:07,watching yeah I tried watching darker than blood and I don't know it I just didn't I watched like one episode and I,
1204,2:16:14,just couldn't get into it like it yeah like I I don't know it felt too chuny,
1205,2:16:20,bill for me like I feel like if I was 10 years younger um no you know,
1206,2:16:27,so much now I get where you're coming from though sometimes an anime just doesn't,
1207,2:16:33,grip you you know what about the Psychopaths do you guys like Psychopaths,
1208,2:16:38,season one only yeah correct that's the correct answer yes,
1209,2:16:45,I'm watching most of season one and then I was thinking of continuing it but then I heard that season two was like yes,
1210,2:16:52,no reason it was so good if you guys like Psychopaths the same person who made,
1211,2:16:59,psychopath season one is also wrote faster what I'm not I mean he didn't write it I,
1212,2:17:06,think he directed it but yeah that's really nice and also the one I recommended Murdoch scrambles also by,
1213,2:17:12,the person who wrote fafner wait is this the same guy that directed Monaco Magicka,
1214,2:17:20,wait wait wait wait wait wait wait no no no not getting a little bit no no no no,
1215,2:17:25,[ __ ] again one,
1216,2:17:31,wait wait wait wait wait wait let me look this up again because he directed Psychopaths and Marco Magica,
1217,2:17:36,that's the same director maybe not the same writer wait wait ER is again butcher,
1218,2:17:45,butcher no I like I like his writing though I mean like it's directing but director,
1219,2:17:52,and writer are not always synonymous with each they're not always the same they're not synonymous they're not always the same,
1220,2:17:58,trying to find wave um let me look on Mel,
1221,2:18:04,uh oh Hellsing I remember that one he's a writer not a director oh wait so,
1222,2:18:10,did he not direct Psychopaths he wrote Psychopaths never man I'm sorry never mind maybe maybe I'm just gonna I'm just,
1223,2:18:18,gonna scoot over to the side and forget because then because never mind um the person,
1224,2:18:23,the person who wrote uh who wrote uh fafner also wrote the script for,
1225,2:18:29,psychopath two and three so never mind,
1226,2:18:42,it looks pretty cool yeah oh yeah I've been meaning to start,
1227,2:18:49,berserk oh I've heard that's right I heard they're going to continue the mango which is so oh yeah it's really,
1228,2:18:57,good I heard I was like oh that's nice mmm [Music],
1229,2:19:03,yeah oh my God we talked a lot we did talk a lot a lot of anime vomit as well,
